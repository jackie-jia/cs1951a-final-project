# Code README

The ML section of our project was redesigned to better our KFold cross validation process, prevent numerical instability when learning, and optimize our hyperparameter settings. A description of the changes can be found in the ML_redesign folder, [here](ML_redesign/). There are no known bugs in our code, and the instructions to run our code is included in the folder!
