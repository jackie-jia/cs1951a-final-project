Our branding is admittedly a little lame, BUT I think it's also what helped it have a slow healthy start. For a sector of crypto that's notorious for chaos, I think this little meme coin is a gem.

gy3yfrt,t3_ncav0n,1621005963,I’ve been in the industry for 5+ years and I don’t really delve intomemetokens for the obvious but when I found out about Loge I couldn’thelp but jump in. The team is very transparent and professional but thecommunity is on a whole other level. Coming from someone who was on thesidelines for Safemoon but followed the project very closely I thinkLoge has started off much better and has just as much potential or morethan Safemoon. I’m sure it’ll be a very bumpy ride but so far it hasbeen very smooth. Even through the dips the community is very outspokenand eager to climb the ranks. In the last 5 years I have not come acrossa better community than I have with Loge. Bought in at 100k and havecontinued buys all the way to 2.5m. I haven’t stopped buying and don’tplan to until we hit 10m. When that happens I will stop accumulating andenjoy the ride to 100m which I believe is very possible.,8,dogecoin

Hey everyone!

We're delighted to announce that our DOGIRA x REAU Investment & Charity NFT campaign is now live!

Four unique NFTs have been created by Dogira community member ""Ur Mum"" (seriously, you gotta make me write that in an official announcement? 😭) - all including a 3D Render of Dogira looking after his animal friends, with a backdrop showing the real animals being looked after by our chosen Animal Shelters & Charities!

Alongside these NFTs all providing much-needed funding to these Charities in need, they also all come with a Dogira investment airdrop incentive; for each NFT you hold, you'll be guaranteed an airdrop of 3,000 Dogira! This return value matches our original CEX Investment NFTs, which matured to being worth a 154% profit at the end of the exact same holding period! (And of course, anything extra you might've earned from re-selling the NFT too 😜)

In addition, if you pick up all 4 unique NFT models, you'll be entered into a draw for 100,000 Dogira, taking place on the date of the Airdrop! (June 25th, 2021)

The airdrop & lottery amounts are entirely covered by the Dogira team (6% of sales are reserved for overheads, with any minor remaining amounts used for offsetting these) - remember when we ""bought the dip""? Yes, obviously it wasn't for ""make market repair""; rather than selling from our LP supply, we bought up our own tokens to help out these incredible charities, and any investment profits are returned directly to the holders, and supporters of these campaigns.

For the full run-down on the vetted (pun not intended) and approved charities we're working with, alongside picking up one of these Dogira-airdrop NFTs yourself, check out the full collection over at rarible.",15,dogecoin

I don’t blame anyone for being skeptical, you should be. 90% of coins on BSC are scams and rugs but I encourage everyone to not gloss over this thread like the others and DYOR.

I really do believe life changing money will be made. I watched Safemoon on the sidelines from the beginning and we have started off so much better.

hsqagbb,t3_s4cjwp,1642224080,"**Project**: Pharmchain , $PHRM 🧊 *price: $.00002 (up 750% this week)
**Sector**: Biotechnology (Pharma) 
**Risk level**: 🔥 🔥 🔥 

**Thesis**: Pharmchain platform aims to solve all the various problems with the antiquated software used by pharmacies and prescribes today. Bridge the gap between Pharma and Blockchain . These problems include: 
* Poor Technical Architecture
* Insecure Platform
* Substandard Patient Integration
Pharmchain will allow: 
* Secure electronic prescriptions, bypassing the data-entry phase in the pharmacy workflow.
* Patients to request pharmacy to pharmacy prescription transfers at the click of a button, eliminating the countless time-consuming phone calls.
* Encrypted medical records and patient information to shared securely amongst physicians, pharmacist, and the patient themselves.
* Patients the ability to confirm a new prescription, refill existing prescriptions, and pay for prescriptions, reducing the amount of time spent processing incoming scripts that inevitably get put back.
Our goal is to constantly seek new and secure ways of data collection and disbursement efficiencies. This would increase patient care, ease the burden of health care provides, and eliminate supply chain issues; all while adding value to our investors. 
As blockchain technology slowly begins to take over, a specialty pharmacy that adopts this technology will put themselves at a significant advantage and would see notable increase in contracts based on their unique competitive edge

**Yield Opps**:  To Incentivize PancakeSwap platform rewards liquidity providers with the platform's native token, CAKE.

The LP tokens will be named in accordance with the pair of tokens you provided, BNB-PHRM LP.
Stake LP tokens.You can now take your newly minted LP tokens to the ""Farms"" section of PancakeSwap and stake them in their corresponding pool. Scroll down the list to find the correct pair, then click ""Enable"" and confirm the deposit in MetaMask.

h3456ym,t3_o87zvq,1624721568,"War of Pups

The year is 2058. 

All currencies have been denominated in doge for the last 30 years. 

As a result, the demand for physical doge and All other pups has skyrocketed their populations into the quintillions. 

Eventually taking over the human population and enslaving them all. 

In the new world,  most pups are left homeless and cannot survive on their own, so they ban together to form large groups.  

Some of these pups have developed a way to become the much wealthiest pups in in the world. 

Others form scavenger groups that pump and dump in  the streets, on lawns, or anywhere that there is enough room to pump each other and take massive dumps. 

These dump piles became a safe haven for some of the last human degenerate survivors that were never enslaved by the Doge overlord, Elon. 

Elon Musk become the first cyber human in 2028. 

On his first trip to Mars in 2026, he discovered core deposits that cointained rare fragments of super magnets. 

Tesla was able to take those magnets and create miniature fusion power cells that are used to power all robotics and electronics that exist today.  

The uprising of the pups was unexpected. 

Nobody thought teaching a dog to use Amazon to order treats would result in dogs gaining access to cyber human technology. 

Once the majority of Doge were connected to the  Web 3.0. 

They were able to order their own food and take Uber’s to their local dog parks. 

Everything was normal until the Crypto kitties attacked.  

The humans lost 80% of their single fertile females in 2035 that year . 

This decimated their population and gave room for the Doge uprising.  

Many pups already lived a life of luxury. 

But there were few doge that were able to horde Elons’ Cyber human technology through Amazon Prime. 

Once enough doge were suited up. 
They attacked the humans. 

Bringing their populations down to the millions.  

The Doge overlords enslaved all humans that would sit and paw and took the rest that refused out the way of old yeller. 

Elon musk was spared as he was was the one human that the dogs needed to achieve their goal. 

To bury a bone on Mars. 

Fights between different species of pups continued for years.  

The War of Pups that continues to ravage the world today was started in 2040.

18 years.  

And in those 18 years, trillions of pups lives were lost and born. 

No doge ever got to sniff Mars. 

They were thwarted by the humans who were able to teach a bunch of old doge new tricks which sabotaged the launch.  

Elon Musks’ Cat-wife was then killed, and he went to the moon to go into hiding. 

This allowed the doge overlords to take complete control and force all humans and other pups to lay down. 

Humans today don’t own pups anymore. 

All they can do is watch them pump and dump while they try to survive in the underworld. 

There are stories of some humans are raising their own pups to fight. 

It’s said they have even have created cyber-pup hybrids to try to fight off the trillions of pups.  

But the doge overlords are too strong and in too big of numbers. 

Their effort is futile. 

But there remains a legend that there is a doge out there that was found or caught by the humans. 

This doge was victim of the terror that most pups lived with daily.  

Some say a samurai was responsible. 

Some say he was attacked by his own pack. 

It’s rumored the humans used his body parts to create a Cyber human doge hybrid. 

They named him $CyberD. 


This doge is    much stronger than any pup that they have ever encountered. 

They developed him as their own doge and taught him how his species has caused the destruction of the world they once knew.  

They say he agreed to help end the uprising and free the humans. 

The war was almost over. But Cyber Doge mission has just begun. 

The one man that could put a stop to this all was not even on the planet anymore. 

Most pups have never made it to the moon, but Cyber technology was built to withstand Mars harsh conditions. 

With the help of the humans, CyberD could make it to the moon and save mankind 🚀",4,dogecoin

Or use Wbtc in defi protocols.
Holders are low, so room to grow. And once there are a good amount of buys and sells with holders >600 payouts will become regular and you can just hold !

Checked back some days or weeks later to see an almost perfectly upward chart. My experience with it now (after having put a bit back in, lol), is that it comes and goes in dips and peaks. Can't say you can time it or other such coins perfectly, but the relatively predictable pattern helps.

I also regret selling my FOX when it recovered enough to make a small profit. Now it's gone almost parabolic. And something tells me these coins have long way to go. I no longer watch the charts obsessively. Don't YOLO your lifesavings in, obviously (though someone might profit enormously from doing so, ha ha, but this is not financial advice).

Most of my crypto investing is done is big market cap alts and BTC, and the great folks over the /r/cryptocurrency tend not to, at least not publicly, love BSC meme/shitcoins, but there's some real potential for profit in BSC. If your gut is saying yes, then put some in, and don't panic at the first time there's a dip. Sometimes you don't have to wait long to profit, and others, like SNOWGE... hell, I'd given up on it, and to my pleasant surprise, it's making a recovery now.

They’ve got some hodlers running ads on Pornhub and Onlyfans, they’re trying to get Mia Khalifa to sponser (she’s involved in crypto), the founder is heavily involved (real, doxxed, and a smokeshow), they’re working on a number of non-porn influencers, the founder is killing it in numerous AMAs, etc. The community is super amped. The thing that impressed me most, though, is they saw the flack Safemoon was getting for not locking their liquidity, so the dev team proactively locked the liquidity (for 69 years, naturally), renounced the contract, and provided proof of both. Like, I legitimately think this thing is gonna pop-off. And I’ve honestly never thought that about a coin in this space. I’m not gonna project DOGE on any of the other joke coins, but this has a DOGE vibe with regards to the fun the community is having with it.

Moonpirate is consolidating right now and I'm not ready to sell at x4. Might be something to look at. I'm still waiting on orfano but feel it coming.

I believe the tokenomics will greatly benefit the token and if the volume keeps up there is no reason why this should not go 100x in the long run.

Big listing on coingecko and coinmarketcap are probably coming soon..

Bi weekly burns are also great.

gxvr4xc,t3_nasmd3,1620843006,"For such a new coin I’ve never seen such a healthy chart. It will be volatile like every other new coin but every dip we all make money. Seeing my Loge increase everyday even on the dips makes me feel as confident as ever. Yesterday was a great run up and we found higher support but with the volume we had I increased my stack quite substantially for one day. Even if the price doesn’t move (it will) with the volume we had yesterday we will all make loads of money. 

The community is on fire and the team is delivering every day. The room for growth is enormous. I don’t blame anyone for being skeptical, you should be. 90% of coins on BSC are scams and rugs but I encourage everyone to not gloss over this thread like the others and DYOR.

I really do believe life changing money will be made. I watched Safemoon on the sidelines from the beginning and we have started off so much better. Just don’t do what I did with Safemoon and watch all the gains on the sidelines. I encourage everyone to atleast join the telegram and ask questions there because the team and community are always willing to help. I don’t see how we will be under a 20m cap in a few days. Within a month I see us climbing to 100m quite easily. The community has seen and done what it takes to climb so quick all we need to do is continue the momentum and do what we have been doing everyday and we will all make life changing money.

hj1ed8d,t3_ql9wge,1635875749,🌈🛣️...💰...amazing project with purpose! Honored I found it and got in so early! Not to late for anyone else at all!,26,shiba_inu
hj1gu7y,t3_ql9wge,1635876724,"All honesty, this is the one.  Slow steady growth not just some shill shitcoin that everyone is trying to pump.  The tokenomics are good, the dev is fully doxxed, and the community is good and growing.  Basically new ATHs daily but without massive spikes of volatility that cause paper hands.

Things people need to know:7% tax, broken down as mentioned above.  The lotto has been a fun thing... some people have bought $200 worth and won $2400, its crazy.  The odds of winning are pretty high (basically if you buy 400M tokens you have a 0.7% chance of winning so at 100 purchases (about $1500-2000 worth of tokens) you accumulate tokens PLUS have a 50% chance of winning the lotto.  That jumps to 75% odds of winning at 200 purchases.  So if you are planning on accumulating anyway just do a bunch of smaller buys and hopefully you'll get a lotto bonus. 

The buyback (1% of the tax) is now at ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND.  That is guaranteed to raise the price when it gets randomly deployed.  Those tokens when bought get burned.  That means over 2 Trillion tokens will be burned on this buyback, currently almost 20% of TOTAL SUPPLY has already been burned, 187 trillion.  The supply is going to decrease faster and faster as volume continues to increase.

The whales are being smart.  So far of the top 30 whales only 1 has liquidated.  2-3 are selling only tiny portions to take some profits but without killing the price.  The top whale sold 2% the other day, holding onto the vast majority and not trying to hurt the project. There is a 21% whale tax if someone tries to sell more than 250B tokens in one day.

The dev had other projects previously which he learned from, in particular changes made to be able to get listed on multiple exchanges.

&#x200B;

There is a sell tax of 14-15%, creating a lot of HODLers and that tax just contributes more to the 2,4,5, and 6 of the buy tax distribution with 1% going to 1,3,7.

Overall I personally do NOT get into many cryptomoonshots but this one I have found worth the risk.  If anyone cares, another one I like is PETS (micropets) but that one hasnt gained the same traction yet.",23,shiba_inu

hsq6uqn,t3_s4627m,1642222146,"**Project**: Pharmchain , $PHRM 🧊 *price: $.00002 (up 750% this week)
**Sector**: Biotechnology (Pharma) 
**Risk level**: 🔥 🔥 🔥 

**Thesis**: Pharmchain platform aims to solve all the various problems with the antiquated software used by pharmacies and prescribes today. Bridge the gap between Pharma and Blockchain . These problems include: 
* Poor Technical Architecture
* Insecure Platform
* Substandard Patient Integration
Pharmchain will allow: 
* Secure electronic prescriptions, bypassing the data-entry phase in the pharmacy workflow.
* Patients to request pharmacy to pharmacy prescription transfers at the click of a button, eliminating the countless time-consuming phone calls.
* Encrypted medical records and patient information to shared securely amongst physicians, pharmacist, and the patient themselves.
* Patients the ability to confirm a new prescription, refill existing prescriptions, and pay for prescriptions, reducing the amount of time spent processing incoming scripts that inevitably get put back.
Our goal is to constantly seek new and secure ways of data collection and disbursement efficiencies. This would increase patient care, ease the burden of health care provides, and eliminate supply chain issues; all while adding value to our investors. 
As blockchain technology slowly begins to take over, a specialty pharmacy that adopts this technology will put themselves at a significant advantage and would see notable increase in contracts based on their unique competitive edge

**Yield Opps**:  To Incentivize PancakeSwap platform rewards liquidity providers with the platform's native token, CAKE.
Add liquidity.Choose how many tokens you wish to add to one half of the pair – the other half will auto-fill. This is due to the pairing needing to be of equivalent value. Details will be provided on your proportional share of the pool, which will dictate the amount of liquidity provider (LP) tokens you receive. The LP tokens will be named in accordance with the pair of tokens you provided, BNB-PHRM LP.
Stake LP tokens.You can now take your newly minted LP tokens to the ""Farms"" section of PancakeSwap and stake them in their corresponding pool. Scroll down the list to find the correct pair, then click ""Enable"" and confirm the deposit in MetaMask.
Earn CAKE and PHRM.Once your LP tokens are deposited, you will immediately start earning CAKE and PHRM rewards at the APR rate specified. You can claim your CAKE at any time by clicking the ""Harvest"" button.

Or use Wbtc in defi protocols.
Holders are low, so room to grow. And once there are a good amount of buys and sells with holders >600 payouts will become regular and you can just hold !

They have an ecosystem of tokens that are well thought out to long term benefit each other. Think of each token as a different product...$DOKI is ultimately for governance, low and fixed supply, bought back from the market to generate dividends for holders. 

$AZUKI is for degacha, a randomized gamified distribution product for nft collectors with utility and base value provided by 3rd party tokens $Doki20 (fractionalized common nfts for base floor value) and $uDOKI which gives ownership in the official collection vault. There is also planned NFT staking and the team has it as a top goal to provide utility and base value to all the NFTs.

$BND, chainbinders, is a new product class for nfts with intrinsic value based in the ETH pool that can be redeemed at anytime so it hits the market of NFT collectors and investors during a period where there are little nft buyers and people want a quick profit. Its also low supply considering 100% of $BND used is burned. Once the machine launches we will see that the product life cycle for bnd will be quick and profitable.

Justin was in the middle of deployment and realised that he may need a few extra ETH for deployment. Because he was deep in the weeds in dev mode, he was neglectful in his actions. This is regrettable. 

He is now in the process of rectifying the situation and will redeposit exactly the same amount of ETH value back into the dev wallet shortly. Once this is done, I will write to the CEO of Dextools to explain the situation. 

We had a similar issue on DGVC, and once explained, the negative tag is removed from the Dextools banner and all was well. We expect this outcome as it is easily explainable and traceable.

Instead of having exposure to a bunch of shitty inflationary governance tokens (badger, farm, others), you earn yield and have exposure to only ONE token that’s deflationary.

Devs unresponsive.   Liquidity drained from Uniswap.   Rug pull.   It's weird to me because they basically waited until the liquidity and token value was bottoming out to rug pull, and that makes me think they might have just decided to pull the plug and use the liquidity to try to recoup their seed capital losses vs intentionally scamming.   That's what I'd like to think at least, but it definitely requires a certain benefit of the doubt.  Sorry to initially endorse something that ended up being not great.**

Wanted to follow up on this project and give an update because I actually saw this post and decided to stake after reading the medium and joining the discord.   Thought it might be helpful for someone to weigh in on their experience.

When I joined the discord, the project was still pre-launch and the discord community was super small.   It's a *very* small dev team, but very passionate about the project and their long term goals with it.  When it was time to launch the farms and seed the liquidity pools on Uniswap, some speculators got the drop on them and started buying and pumping the price while the market maker was still seeding the pools.   This caused a big initial pump and then sudden, immediate crash which nearly sank the project.  Initial price offering was supposed to be $1.25, and ended up hitting $.05 minutes after launch due to the pump and dump crowd.

A chunk of people left and then a chunk kept farming and compounding the farm.  The APY was pretty good, regardless.   I was playing with yield from other farm projects, so I had less at stake, but there were others who were salty about having lost a lot out the gate during the initial pump.   Also, the impermanent loss in the pools was huge, for obvious reasons.

That said, the devs rallied and ultimately released updates to their UI and a roadmap of what happens next, expanding on the future utility of their initial PadThai token and revealing an initial community burn event to mint their governance token PTK (not avail on Uniswap yet - happening tomorrow at 2:45am).    The burn event was a big deal because PadThai basically had runaway inflation due to the incentivized pools.   The token price stabilized after the crash.   Still worth very, very little, but not plummeting like before.  The community could tell that the devs were committed to sticking around and building out the rest of their ecosystem and roadmap.

Fast forward to tonight, and the burn event to migrate PadThai to PTK has commenced at [kingme.padthai.finance](https://kingme.padthai.finance).   PTK has a small, fixed total supply and vests over 30 days to prevent immediate dumps.   Liquidity gets added to Uniswap in roughly 21hrs, as mentioned above.

Still can't say for sure what the long, long term prospects are for the project, but still feeling good about it so far.  And the interesting thing is it's still essentially early.   Price of PadThai is still very low and the migration exchange rate to PTK isn't awful yet (although it will get worse over time as more PadThai gets burned).   The devs have plenty they plan to roll out, so should be fun to see what happens next.

Anyway, there's your update from someone who jumped in through this initial post and has been riding the wave with everyone else.  Hope it as helpful or informative at least.   :)",3,sushi
