I\u2019ll try to actually write something constructive here.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna say that EMBR will moon, and I honestly don\u2019t want it to unless it\u2019s organic growth. I have followed the team\u2019s development since it began and they have a lot of projects in the works that you can find out about on the discord. \n\nAt least take a look at it, I purchased some tokens during the public presale and some more at launch. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll likely hold most of for the next year or so and just see how the team progresses. It\u2019s probably the most ambitious project I\u2019ve seen in BSC so far, and is set up from the start to allow the developers to actually achieve what they want with it.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\n\nEdit: for the people concerned about the bonfire comments, please understand that it is a valid concern but something you must research. The word rug-pull is inaccurate. I am not trying to shill EMBR or encourage the purchase of it, simply giving my perspective. I put a comfortable amount of money into this project because I am willing to lose it.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable placing funds in a new, speculative project, then don\u2019t. Any money you voluntarily place into a project is 100% your responsibility at that point, crypto is volatile as fuck and most BSC projects in the past have boiled down to being gambling. I believe EMBR differentiates itself from the typical BSC token, but that is a personal belief and decision, do not base your own decisions completely off of what others say.","1493":"EMBR is going crazy already!

The original rug pull happened about two weeks after the token was started, way back in April or May I think.

I have followed the team\u2019s development since it began and they have a lot of projects in the works that you can find out about on the discord. \n\nAt least take a look at it, I purchased some tokens during the public presale and some more at launch. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll likely hold most of for the next year or so and just see how the team progresses. It\u2019s probably the most ambitious project I\u2019ve seen in BSC so far, and is set up from the start to allow the developers to actually achieve what they want with it.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\n\nEdit: for the people concerned about the bonfire comments, please understand that it is a valid concern but something you must research. The word rug-pull is inaccurate. I am not trying to shill EMBR or encourage the purchase of it, simply giving my perspective. I put a comfortable amount of money into this project because I am willing to lose it.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable placing funds in a new, speculative project, then don\u2019t. Any money you voluntarily place into a project is 100% your responsibility at that point, crypto is volatile as fuck and most BSC projects in the past have boiled down to being gambling. I believe EMBR differentiates itself from the typical BSC token, but that is a personal belief and decision, do not base your own decisions completely off of what others say.","2349":"EMBR is going crazy already!

In layman's terms - it can scale without limits while preserving the amazing behavior (composability of dApps) we grew to love in Ethereum.\n\nSafety - In a few weeks, Radix will introduce Scrypto. Their approach to on ledger computation (smart contracts). Unlike the Ethereum approach (the EVM that has been adopted by a majority of the L1's), Scrypto is asset oriented. Assets are in the center, how assets should and can be managed -- this and more increases safety and dramatically reduces the chances of bugs and exploits.\n\nEfficiency and productivity of developers is increased dramatically with Scrypto. As developers are given strong tools to building decentralized financial applications, they can focus more on building and less on auditing and testing.\n\nBut above all, Radix wants crypto as a whole to succeed. Radix isn't here to replace any other platform but to work together and bring crypto to the masses. The vision is a new financial future, a better future, for all.

This begins in the current Radix' presence in the WebSummit conference.\n\nFrom a technological point of view, Radix solves 3 major things (1) scalability (2) safety (3) efficiency.\n\nScalability - Radix' novel concensus Cerberus enables cross shard composability. In layman's terms - it can scale without limits while preserving the amazing behavior (composability of dApps) we grew to love in Ethereum.\n\nSafety - In a few weeks, Radix will introduce Scrypto. Their approach to on ledger computation (smart contracts). Unlike the Ethereum approach (the EVM that has been adopted by a majority of the L1's), Scrypto is asset oriented. Assets are in the center, how assets should and can be managed -- this and more increases safety and dramatically reduces the chances of bugs and exploits.\n\nEfficiency and productivity of developers is increased dramatically with Scrypto. As developers are given strong tools to building decentralized financial applications, they can focus more on building and less on auditing and testing.\n\nBut above all, Radix wants crypto as a whole to succeed. Radix isn't here to replace any other platform but to work together and bring crypto to the masses. The vision is a new financial future, a better future, for all.

This would increase patient care, ease the burden of health care provides, and eliminate supply chain issues; all while adding value to our investors.\u00a0\nAs blockchain technology slowly begins to take over, a specialty pharmacy that adopts this technology will put themselves at a significant advantage and would see notable increase in contracts based on their unique competitive edge\n\n**Yield Opps**:  To Incentivize PancakeSwap platform rewards liquidity providers with the platform's native token, CAKE.\nAdd liquidity.Choose how many tokens you wish to add to one half of the pair \u2013 the other half will auto-fill.

Any money you voluntarily place into a project is 100% your responsibility at that point, crypto is volatile as fuck and most BSC projects in the past have boiled down to being gambling.
