This return value matches our original CEX Investment NFTs, which matured to being worth a 154% profit at the end of the exact same holding period! (And of course, anything extra you might've earned from re-selling the NFT too \ud83d\ude1c)\n\nIn addition, if you pick up all 4 unique NFT models, you'll be entered into a draw for 100,000 Dogira, taking place on the date of the Airdrop! (June 25th, 2021)\n\nThe airdrop & lottery amounts are entirely covered by the Dogira team (6% of sales are reserved for overheads, with any minor remaining amounts used for offsetting these) - remember when we \"bought the dip\"? Yes, obviously it wasn't for \"make market repair\"; rather than selling from our LP supply, we bought up our own tokens to help out these incredible charities, and any investment profits are returned directly to the holders, and supporters of these campaigns.\n\nFor the full run-down on the vetted (pun not intended) and approved charities we're working with, alongside picking up one of these Dogira-airdrop NFTs yourself, check out the full collection over at rarible.","1620":"This coin is being developed to have proper utility as well.

But Cyber Doge mission has just begun. \n\nThe one man that could put a stop to this all was not even on the planet anymore. \n\nMost pups have never made it to the moon, but Cyber technology was built to withstand Mars harsh conditions. \n\nWith the help of the humans, CyberD could make it to the moon and save mankind \ud83d\ude80","2768":"Bought a large bag!

I usually get in with my fingers crossed. But I\u2019ve been watching the dev group closely, and they are absolutely killing it! Bought in yesterday and again today. The marketing has been great. They\u2019ve got some hodlers running ads on Pornhub and Onlyfans, they\u2019re trying to get Mia Khalifa to sponser (she\u2019s involved in crypto), the founder is heavily involved (real, doxxed, and a smokeshow), they\u2019re working on a number of non-porn influencers, the founder is killing it in numerous AMAs, etc. The community is super amped. The thing that impressed me most, though, is they saw the flack Safemoon was getting for not locking their liquidity, so the dev team proactively locked the liquidity (for 69 years, naturally), renounced the contract, and provided proof of both. Like, I legitimately think this thing is gonna pop-off. And I\u2019ve honestly never thought that about a coin in this space. I\u2019m not gonna project DOGE on any of the other joke coins, but this has a DOGE vibe with regards to the fun the community is having with it. Also, it does hav a useful element in that a small share is donated to animal shelters and women\u2019s shelters. I\u2019m bullish AF.","3594":"What counts as \"Milestones\"?","3595":"Nailed it.
