Its not just one product but a whole ecosystem.\n\nThey have an ecosystem of tokens that are well thought out to long term benefit each other.

There is also planned NFT staking and the team has it as a top goal to provide utility and base value to all the NFTs.\n\n$BND, chainbinders, is a new product class for nfts with intrinsic value based in the ETH pool that can be redeemed at anytime so it hits the market of NFT collectors and investors during a period where there are little nft buyers and people want a quick profit. Its also low supply considering 100% of $BND used is burned. Once the machine launches we will see that the product life cycle for bnd will be quick and profitable. Furthermore $AZUKI is required to redeem ETH and burn the NFT and 5% of all nft eth redeem goes to buy back $DOKI.","1146":"Doki machines look WAY TOO ADDICTIVE!

Witnessing this first hand with one whale wallet controlling the community vote on SushiSwap proposals was very discouraging toward my hope for DeFi.   However, last month I learned about Dracula protocol on the SushiSwap forum due to a member submitted proposal advocating that SushiSwap change the rules after the fact and strip vested SUSHI rewards from the Dracula protocol (and others) because the SushiSwap bag holders don't like being vampired and token dumped (oh the irony.)  .... and some of my hope was restored... Someone is fighting against the whales.\n\nIt would be nice to have a one for all and all for one kind of community and some cooperative influence to work together so I've invested in Dracula and will be moving my LPs over at v2 launch.","1217":"Dracula protocol:\n\nWebsite \u2014 [https:\/\/dracula.sucks\/](https:\/\/dracula.sucks\/)\n\nToad Network:\n\nWebsite \u2014 [www.toad.network](https:\/\/www.toad.network\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReddit won't let me share other social media links even in comments, sad.\n\nDracula has:\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nMedium\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedIn\n\nClubHouse\n\nHive\n\nSteemit\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToad Network has:\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nMedium\n\nInstagram","1218":"Well explained.

Would love to give it a try but upfront GAS costs are stupid right now.","1566":"Costs exorbitant gas fees to move on and off chain and if using plasma takes 7 days. Doesn't offer anything close to the number of trading pairs on uniswap. Will always be behind uniswap when it comes to new tokens, if the tokens ever even get listed. That said, it was a painless experience when I got on the chain, just didn't see much to do on it, since it didn't offer the variety and new tokens uniswap or even BSC has.

Real world deployments sit around 450 TPS right now. Plasma can reach 65,000 TPS with 10k+ TPS current real world performance.\n\nIt also makes little sense to offload DEX's onto ORU's when it's cheaper and faster to do the transactions via Plasma. Even with Optimism fees will remain 5-10 cents. Plasma cuts transactions to hundredth of a cent.\n\nPolygon (Matic) will be offering ORU's as one of several options within their platform. Developers will be able to choose from Plasma, zkRollups, or Optimistic Rollups - or a combination of them to scale their dapp.","1577":"Yes well, Quickswap is new, I'm not sure what you're expecting. Obviously if they were at the same stage as Uniswap their MC would reflect that. \n\nThe gas fees are from the Ethereum mainnet. MATIC solves gas fees.\n\nMATIC is implementing optimistic rollups, how is that bearish? Have you even researched MATIC?","1578":"How is it overvalued? Its market cap is lower than liquidity on the actual exchange so its actually undervalued when comparing to uni and cake. Anyswap is on a 10:1 cap to liquidity last time I checked if you want to see overvalued.","1579":">Personally, I think QUICK is overvalued. Zero.exchange, Zeroswap, and DxSale are all much better risk\/reward ratios IMO.\n\nI appreciate the alternate viewpoint.  I kicked the tires on the avax chain dexes (pangolin, [zero.exchange](https:\/\/zero.exchange), complus, etc.) but avax doesn't have the biz dev of matic right now.  Whomever is running matic biz dev is on fire, multiple announcements a day, and quickswap LP farming rewards highlight the best alts on matic every week (e.g., recently SX, GHST, SWAP, and FRAX\/FXS).  So it's been a win-win-win (QUICK appreciates, other coin in the pair appreciates, plus farming rewards) and I moved everything over to quickswap.  Things change quickly in crypto so I'll be monitoring these other dex opportunities in case things change, but right now quickswap is where it's at for me.","1580":"I like [Zero.exchange](https:\/\/Zero.exchange) as well, but I'm not sure about Zeroswap, do they have a working solution?","1581":"Replying to myself so that anyone who reads this does themselves the service of looking into all three of the above.

Any reason why they got the hookup for 2x?","1605":"**EDIT:**   **Leaving my original post up so people can see how fast things can change with these projects, but this morning, woke up to this project's website and discord both being shutdown.   Devs unresponsive.   Liquidity drained from Uniswap.   Rug pull.   It's weird to me because they basically waited until the liquidity and token value was bottoming out to rug pull, and that makes me think they might have just decided to pull the plug and use the liquidity to try to recoup their seed capital losses vs intentionally scamming.   That's what I'd like to think at least, but it definitely requires a certain benefit of the doubt.  Sorry to initially endorse something that ended up being not great.**\n\nWanted to follow up on this project and give an update because I actually saw this post and decided to stake after reading the medium and joining the discord.   Thought it might be helpful for someone to weigh in on their experience.\n\nWhen I joined the discord, the project was still pre-launch and the discord community was super small.   It's a *very* small dev team, but very passionate about the project and their long term goals with it.  When it was time to launch the farms and seed the liquidity pools on Uniswap, some speculators got the drop on them and started buying and pumping the price while the market maker was still seeding the pools.   This caused a big initial pump and then sudden, immediate crash which nearly sank the project.  Initial price offering was supposed to be $1.25, and ended up hitting $.05 minutes after launch due to the pump and dump crowd.\n\nA chunk of people left and then a chunk kept farming and compounding the farm.  The APY was pretty good, regardless.   I was playing with yield from other farm projects, so I had less at stake, but there were others who were salty about having lost a lot out the gate during the initial pump.   Also, the impermanent loss in the pools was huge, for obvious reasons.\n\nThat said, the devs rallied and ultimately released updates to their UI and a roadmap of what happens next, expanding on the future utility of their initial PadThai token and revealing an initial community burn event to mint their governance token PTK (not avail on Uniswap yet - happening tomorrow at 2:45am).    The burn event was a big deal because PadThai basically had runaway inflation due to the incentivized pools.   The token price stabilized after the crash.   Still worth very, very little, but not plummeting like before.  The community could tell that the devs were committed to sticking around and building out the rest of their ecosystem and roadmap.\n\nFast forward to tonight, and the burn event to migrate PadThai to PTK has commenced at [kingme.padthai.finance](https:\/\/kingme.padthai.finance).   PTK has a small, fixed total supply and vests over 30 days to prevent immediate dumps.   Liquidity gets added to Uniswap in roughly 21hrs, as mentioned above.\n\nStill can't say for sure what the long, long term prospects are for the project, but still feeling good about it so far.  And the interesting thing is it's still essentially early.   Price of PadThai is still very low and the migration exchange rate to PTK isn't awful yet (although it will get worse over time as more PadThai gets burned).   The devs have plenty they plan to roll out, so should be fun to see what happens next.\n\nAnyway, there's your update from someone who jumped in through this initial post and has been riding the wave with everyone else.  Hope it as helpful or informative at least.   :)","1606":"How much is initial liquidity?","1607":"I\u2019m making fucking bank on this haha holy shit i bought at the lowest of low","1608":"Whats degen farming?","1609":"Where's the fucking discord.
