The token is UNIDX. The platform shares 50% of all fees with holders, and all holders have to do is hold the token in their wallet. No staking required (though optional single-side staking is coming up to get\u00a0even more rewards). To evaluate the potential for yourself, check out the terminal yourself to get a sense of what it does (and how nice it looks compared to more popular competing projects, like DYDX). With a market cap of just **$4 million**, a doxxed team, and a fully\u00a0functioning product, it is only a matter of time before this undervalued project moons.\u00a0\n\nLinks: https:\/\/unidexbeta.app\/trading , https:\/\/unidex.exchange\/calculator.html , https:\/\/twitter.com\/UniDexFinance\n\n**Why the token price will increase:** It comes down to volume on the platform.\n\nThe daily volume on UniDex has been steadily rising\u00a0over the past 6 months, now approaching $1 million per day. So, if you hold 10,000 UNIDX tokens, that means you get about $4 per day. Not much. But if volume keeps uptrending over the next few months \u2014 say, $30 million a day, which is a relatively small number compared to large DEXes \u2014 then that same holding will net you ~$120 per day. (Of course, the long-term goal is to reach CEX-like trading volume at amounts over $1 billion per day, but just keeping things conservative for now.)\n\nIf the volume keeps the trend, many holders will logically choose to reinvest their rewards for more UNIDX, anticipating that they can greatly boost their future rewards by accumulating more of the token while it's cheap. (The token is sitting at $4 million MC.) As volume picks up, this will put steady buy pressure on the token from smart holders who want to boost future\u00a0rewards. So will the (optional) single-side staking: The terminal will auto buyback UNIDX tokens and distribute them to stakers, adding to the buy pressure and effectively taking tokens out of the circulating supply.\n\n**Why volume will increase:** In addition to the organic uptrend in volume from new users, UniDex is working with numerous partners who are integrating the terminal's API into their currently existing products. That means that much of the volume on those already-popular projects will be transferred through UniDex, boosting the daily rewards for holders. With more integrations, the volume will only continue to grow. To estimate the future potential of the project for yourself, I'd suggest going to the terminal and checking out how it routes and aggregates your orders, and comparing those same trades on other projects. See for yourself if using it could save you money, and then look into the existing projects who are actively incorporating\u00a0UniDex tech into their own products.\nOther products that will add to volume: Leverage on Fantom,\u00a0an extremely efficient auto harvester and compounder, exotic trading pairs, and an upcoming \"simple mode\" for beginner traders. More information on the platform's Medium page: https:\/\/unidexfinance.medium.com\/?p=bf9f1bc24bcf\n\n**Background**: UniDex is a working trading terminal that aims to bring a best-in-class trading experience to DeFi. One of the biggest problems in DeFi trading right now lies in fragmentation and a lack of tools that experienced traders need: charting, limit orders, advanced analytics, and a polished interface.\n\u00a0\nThe terminal has been operational for about a year, during which it's launched its unique aggregator\/routing technology on more than 20 chains. UniDex takes a no-bias approach in terms of routing: Rather than just picking \"the best\" dex for your order, UniDex will find the most efficient path every time, which might mean splitting your order so that 60% goes through SushiSwap, 20% through SpiritSwap, and 20% through Beethovenx. Over time, the fees traders save add up \u2014 in some cases, this kind of efficient routing can save you thousands in USD value on a trade.\u00a0","5":"Welcome to Black kitty sushi community \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBlack kitty sushi joins the kitty family to become the leading player of meme tokens.

Rubic already allows ANY token to be swapped for ANY OTHER token on 7-8 major Blockchains.\n\n[rubic.exchange](https:\/\/rubic.exchange\/)\n\n[https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/rubic\/](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/rubic\/)\n\nThere is already more than 10,500+ tokens to be swapped with cheapest fees on Rubic exchange between:\n\n* Ethereum\n* Binance Smart Chain\n* Polygon\n* Avalanche\n* Moonbeam\n* Fantom\n* Solana\n* Harmony\n\nYou can also combine a bridge and a swap into one transaction for the user. You can trade LINK ERC-20 for CAKE BEP-20 right now for example, something we often take for granted on a centralized exchange that is difficult to do in a decentralized manner.\n\nRubic also doubles as an aggregator with 60+ DEXs built in and they only charge their provider fee on crosschain swaps so you can access Uniswap, 1INCH, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, Trader Joe, Pangolin, Spookyswap, Spiritswap, 0x and more all from one browser tab or right on your phone.\n\nI honestly cannot believe this project hasn't blown up more with staking already implemented with 80% APY (no additional minting of tokens so it is a deflationary coin unlike pancake swap staking).\n\nAt the time of writing the market cap of their RBC token is under $31 million, with 110 million tokens circulating out of 124 million tokens total. Basically no giant token unlocks for VCs to dump on you and the potential of 100x returns with its current market cap and already delivered functionality is not farfetched.\n\nBTC integration, mobile app, liquidity provision and governance slated for first half of next year.

Instead of p2p NFT lending (like u\/nftfi), it will offer instant loans against NFT collateral.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do NFT Loans work on Drops?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will simply have to deposit your NFT into the Drops platform to start lending out your NFT and start earning interest on it. There will be multiple pools. - Each project (eg. BAYC) has their own risk reward profile for the pool. Anyone can supply collateral (NFTs or Tokens) and borrow stables for liquidity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow revolutionairy is this ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt means that any NFT owner can start farming\/staking their NFT\u2019s earning interest, putting their NFT\u2019s to work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDrops could change the NFT space forever & crypto as a whole. It will instantly make NFT\u2019s more valuable. Besides that Drops will improve the liquidity of NFT\u2019s dramatically. NFT Pools on Drops can be routed to different networks and DEX\u2019s. Drops can attract billions in NFT TVL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompetitors of Drops\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDrops doesn\u2019t have any competitor, its the first to deploy non p2p NFT loans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProjects that look like Drops are p2p NFT Lending platforms like u\/nftfi.

Flame Token is the native currency of Sharesome, the first social discovery network for adult content creators and brands. Sharesome is designed to connect all stakeholders in the adult industry.  \n \n\nThe team behind Flame did a lot of things different from usual crypto projects. For example, they build the utility before they launched the token. Now, Flame has already 1.6M monthly active user. You want to know more? Visit [https:\/\/flametoken.io\/](https:\/\/flametoken.io\/)\n\n**How does this work?**  **\ud83d\udcad**    \n Think of Sharesome as a mix between Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit \u2013 without the hate-speech, but with the nudes. Sharesome has already 1.6M monthly active users and 500M monthly post views. Already, every month 30M paid posts are sold, generating a monthly revenue of 700.000 XFL. The project onboarded and verified over 7,000 content creators and growing.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f **1. Doing things in the right order**  \n Normally there is an ICO and then maybe a product.

FINMA ruling**  \n The project has obtained a no-action letter from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **4. 100% organic growth**  \n Sharesome grew organically from day one. Network effects give the project an edge compared to traditional adult websites.\n\n\ud83e\udd47 **5. The internet is for porn**  \n Porn has always been driving technological innovation.

Extreme market push. Huge market cap in the making. Active market. Buy on Uniswap.\n\nIts main competitor, $ICE, had a $32 mil. market cap on 5 September. Two months later, on 5 November, $ICE hit an ATH of $695 mil. market cap.\n\nCurrently, on 17 November, $PILOT has a $56 mil. mcap. Can it grow to $1.3 bil mcap., in the same time span, in two months, on 17 January? I think it can. I will explain why.\n\n$PILOT and $ICE are automatic liquidity optimizers, but $PILOT has the advantage to be universal. This means LPs can provide liquidity for ANY Uniswap pair. $ICE has only a limited amount of about 20 set pools, while $PILOT can provide pools for an unlimited number of pairs. \n\nThe second biggest difference between $PILOT and $ICE is the Unipilot Index Fund. $PILOT takes a percentage of the fees earned by LPs and sends it to the Index Fund. The Index Fund will contain mainly blue chips. Users will be able to burn their $PILOT tokens, to have exposure to the Index Fund tokens. Why would people exchange their $PILOT for the Index Fund share of tokens? Because at some point, you might have $1000 in $PILOT tokens, but if you burn it, you could get $1500 worth of tokens from the Index Fund. So, you burn your $PILOT, claim your tokens from the Index Fund, and you can re-buy even more $PILOT. The Index Fund will work as a rising price floor for $PILOT. The Index Fund can pump $PILOT price, in these situations.\n\nIn addition, 78% of the supply will be burnt over 3 years, quarterly, by the team, including their own tokens! So, with all the burns done each time someone wants to get access to the Index Fund tokens, $PILOT has deflationary tokenomics.\n\nMainnet for $PILOT is set for 18th November. After mainnet, $PILOT has tons of updates planned: \n1. Cross chain \n2. Sushiswap Trident support \n3. xPILOT and $PILOT staking \n4. Flash fees & Index pools \n5. Interest free stable coin loans \n6. Locking liquidity solution on Uniswap v3 \n...and much more.\n\n$PILOT team is planning a so-called Vampire Attack on mainnet launch day, a lot of liquidity will be directed into protocol. So what is a Vampire Attack? The liquidity is basically sucked out of the first platform and moved into the second platform, hence the name. The first step of a Vampire Attack is to incentivise liquidity providers of another platform to stake their LP tokens, which represent supplied liquidity, to a new platform. It's what Sushiswap did with Uniswap.\n\nBecause $PILOT is the ONLY universal optimizer on the market, huge amounts of liquidity will come through the Pilot Protocol. The TVL and the Index Fund will grow accordingly, with tens or even hundreds of millions each month. The price of $PILOT will moon hard. Remember that it was fair launched, so there are no presalers or VCs to dump on you. The liquidity on Uniswap is huge (currently sitting at $20 mil.), so whales will be attracted to buy huge stacks of $PILOT.\n\nOne more thing, $PILOT has received an #Uniswap grant and passed with flying colors 3 independent audits. Hundreds of people were involved in testnet contests. I already saw the interface of their platform and the UI is simply amazing. I think you haven't seen anything yet. The best part of the price action for $PILOT will come after the mainnet. Farming will be launched in the same day with the mainnet launch.\n\nMost people wanted to see all those features working live before they buy $PILOT, so I assume after it will go live, they will FOMO buy it. Avoid the FOMO while you still can and buy a $PILOT bag now. $PILOT to $1200? Possibly. $PILOT to $600? Probably.\n\nYou can buy $PILOT on Uniswap.

FOR A PROJECT THAT COULD BECOME THE LEADER IN ONLINE BETTING!! Once this gets added to Raydium in the next day, I expect all of the Solana hype beasts to jump in and start buying. Given the small market cap, it wouldn't take much for this thing to take off. Please DYOR, but read below for high level summary (not financial advice):\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\nKineko ($KKO) is a fully licensed, high throughput bookmaker focused on traditional casino games, and Sports\/eSports betting. The bull story\/rationale for Kineko\u2019s value-add is obvious \u2013 global governments are increasingly imposing stricter regulations on online casino operators, directly interfering with the user experience by creating complex rules and restrictions. Extrapolating this trend shows the importance of creating a future in which online betting is decentralized and crypto-based. The consequence is that betting site operators around the world are being forced into thinking about technological innovation.\n\nThe Kineko betting app utilizes the support of a DeFi ecosystem to bootstrap liquidity of the native token $KKO. The native token is used for both rewards on the exchange and for participating in liquidity programs, allowing the Kineko to reward any participant, whether they\u2019re betting or simply staking.\n\nWhat is the incentive for users to use the Kineko platform?\n\n1. People that bet using the native $KKO token receive 2% cash back for all bets. Why place bets at 1.9 odds (-110 for the Americans among us), when you can place bets at 1.92\/-108?!\n2. Kineko sets aside a monthly emission of coins to rewards users that bet using their platform. For all wagers placed at odds of 1.5 or greater, users receive a % of the volume pool. So for example, a user generating 3% of monthly betting volume is entitled to 3% of this pool, which can be quite substantial. Last month\u2019s pool was 154,000 $KKO, so 3% of the volume would have earned you 4,620 $KKO.\n\nSince launching in June 2021, Kineko\u2019s website has already amassed over 5,000 active daily users. Total betting volume in October was $6.76m, with $3.6m coming from the casino and $3.1m coming from the sportsbook. In the first four months of operation, they have generated $514,400 of profit, of which 50% has been used to burn overall token supply. This isn\u2019t a pie in the sky crypto\u2026 it\u2019s a real business that is already generating substantial revenue and profit. If you annualize October\u2019s financials, they are generating $81.1mm of gambling volumes, and $1.54mm of profit. That compares to current market cap of \\~$9mm (6x cash flow).\n\nThe company\u2019s success comes despite the fact that, to date, they have not allocated any resources to marketing. The development team has solely prioritized optimizing the betting website first, which is now complete. Word-of-mouth alone has got them to $81m of volume and $1.5m of profit. Add some gasoline to the fire (marketing), and those numbers will be multiples of what we\u2019re seeing today.\n\nWithin the next 1-2 quarters, there should be three big catalysts:\n\n1. Migration to Solana. This is a big move, and one that I think will be key long-term. Ethereum fees, as we all know, are insane! Gas fees are cost prohibitive for an extremely long-tail low volume gamblers that don\u2019t want to spend $200 of fees for a $100 bet. Solana, on the other hand, has negligible fees (under 1c), making betting on the website far more accessible \u2013 both for gamblers and for investors. This process has just started\n2. Marketing! The company is launching an affiliate marketing program \u201cin the next few weeks.\u201d Like I said before, this essentially adds gasoline to the fire. More users will lead to higher betting volumes, which will generate higher revenues and profit.\n3. Getting added to a CEX (Centralized Exchange). One of the main drawbacks today is the difficulty in buying $KKO. I\u2019ll put together some steps on how to buy below, but quite frankly, it is not a simple process for more mainstream crypto investors. Getting added to an exchange such as FTX, or something similar, will be a complete game changer. All of a sudden, users will not have to transfer crypto between different wallets \u2013 it will be as simple as depositing money and buying $KKO. And, lest we forget, the exchanges will have to buy significant amounts of coin in advance of a listing. Kineko is targeting being added to an exchange in 4Q21 or 1Q22, following the migration to Solana and their big marketing push.\n\nMoving on to valuation. I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you that this is a 10x, a 20x, or a 50x\u2026that is ultimately up to you to decide. I am, however, going to give you valuation data points that I think are eye opening for the potential of this project. DraftKings trades at 16x revenue, and currently loses(!) money. Based on Kineko\u2019s annualized revenue of $81mm, below are some potential valuations at varying revenue multiples:\n\n\\- 16x revenue multiple = $1.3bn valuation (236x return)\n\n\\- 10x revenue multiple = $800m valuation (145x return)\n\n\\- 5x revenue multiple = $400m valuation (72x return)\n\nSo, what is the valuation today\u2026and where is Kineko ($KKO) currently creating? The market cap is currently $5.5 million. Again, choose whichever revenue multiple you would like, but you are creating today at 0.07x revenue. And unlike Draftkings, Kineko is profitable. Assuming zero growth (lol), you are creating Kineko today for 3.6x cash flow ($1.5m\/year).\n\nEnough screaming at the screen, here are the few steps you need to follow to buy the coin:\n\n1. Buy Ethereum\n2. Create a MetaMask wallet, and send the Ethereum to this wallet address\n3. Go to SushiSwap and connect your wallet\n4. Swap Ethereum for Kineko\n5.

The primary component of Doge Protocol will be a quantum-resistant\n\nblockchain that supports smart contracts, side chains and is scalable in the number\n\nof transactions. \n\n**\ud83d\udc49 $Doge Protocol** **blockchain?**\n\nA robust and scalable blockchain will be required to serve as the backbone for executing the vision of Doge Protocol, upon which other building blocks can be developed. **This blockchain will become the first one to be quantum resistant, proof of stake with smart contract support**\n\n**\ud83d\udc49 Quantum Resistance?**\n\nWhitepaper: [https:\/\/github.com\/DogeProtocol\/Doge-Protocol-Whitepapers\/blob\/main\/Doge-Protocol-Blockchain-Quantum-Resistance-Whitepaper.pdf](https:\/\/github.com\/DogeProtocol\/Doge-Protocol-Whitepapers\/blob\/main\/Doge-Protocol-Blockchain-Quantum-Resistance-Whitepaper.pdf) \n\nThere is also a specific reason why this blockchain must be quantum-resistant. Due to the advent of quantum computers, there is an imminent threat to existing asymmetric encryption systems like RSA, ECDSA that are used to secure almost all the current blockchains. Using algorithms like Shor\u2019s (rapid integer factorization) and Grover\u2019s (quadratic mining speedup on Proof of Work systems), Quantum Computers can break current blockchains in different ways. One of the visions of the Doge Protocol is that it should be secure in the future as well.\n\nSecurity itself evolves over time, hence no algorithm should be deemed future proof, including current quantum-resistant algorithms. However, but from the current landscape, quantum computers are a viable threat to blockchains. Hence the vision is to build a blockchain that is resistant to currently known quantum computer threats and keep it evolving based on the changing security landscape. \n\n**\ud83d\udc8eTokenomics:**\n\n\ud83d\udccc Symbol: DogeP\n\nDoge Protocol was launched in a fair manner on the Ethereum Blockchain on September 1, 2021.

The process to get DogeP coins for token holders will be given before mainnet launch.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Total supply: 100 trillion.\n\n\ud83d\udcccThere was no presale or ICO.\n\n\ud83d\udcccThere was no dev team or founder allocation.\n\n\ud83d\udcb2 Deflationary: 0.1% burn on each transaction.\n\n\ud83d\udcb2 Maximum allowed tokens per account at launch: 0.99%\n\n**\ud83c\udf10Whitepaper done?

I plan to hold until at least $2-$3 (which should come soon), and heres why.\n\nThe project has extreme potential. I would honestly call it revolutionary for lack of a less dramatic word. Basically, those who have BTC have nothing to do with it in terms of compounding their capital, outside of hodling of course. Although hodling BTC has been insanely profitable, as we all know, Strudel will allow Bitcoin to become more versatile by integrating its vBTC coin (pegged to Bitcoin) with the ERC20 interface and smart contract interoperability. When you burn BTC, vBTC is minted.\n\nWhat if you want your Bitcoin back? Simply exchange your new vBTC for another coin, then back to BTC.\n\nThe Strudel coin is the governance token for vBTC, and acts as the intermediary that wraps BTC and creates the oft-mentioned trustless bridge. When such a bridge is trusted, several people own the digital signatures that form the essence of wBTC. Technically, it is possible for these people to collaborate and rugpull, as they are the ones that own the signatures to the bitcoin. With Strudel, this bridge is trustless, meaning that the aforementioned digital signatures are not in the hands of others. Still to this point, they haven\u2019t pulled the rug in all this time and have built trust with the community. \n\nNow onto the other aspects of this coin.\n\nIt was created by Keno, who went on to be a core dev at Sushi--he is now back on the Strudel team as an advisor.\n\nHolders and volume have increased at a great rate over the past few days. \n\nVery low mCap, especially compared to Ren, the closest thing to a competitor.\n\nThe project leaders have been working on this for a year now and they have done so much to keep the project alive and well.

Well, it's because this project is an actual technical advancement in the Defi space, not the 100th fork of another project on a new chain, it doesn't need this kind of marketing.\n\n**Well what is $KAE?**\n\nIt's an individualized lending\/borrowing app, which means in comparison to AAVE\/Compound lenders and borrowers aren't pooled together driving rates down, but matched individually giving much better rates. Borrowers are also rewarded with the KAE token for repaying their loans in addition to other advantages the KAE tokens provides for users of the platform.\n\n* No VCs, no ICO\/IDO, 100% community driven\n* Releasing on FTM in a few weeks (awaiting audit)\n* The project already released on ETH and took off, but usage dropped due to high fees, considered a MVP with v2 on FTM having much more features\n* sub 5m MC, only 450 holders\n* Developed even before Compound \n* The lead dev has strong ties to Andre Cronje \n\nThere is a recent AMA done by the SUSHI team which is very informative: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ytjnv6P8TJQ\n\nTelegram: https:\/\/t.me\/kanpeki_finance\n\nWebsite: https:\/\/kanpeki.finance\/\n\nDextools: https:\/\/www.dextools.io\/app\/ether\/pair-explorer\/0x400043e27415773e4a509c53ac5d7d3c036f6d92\n\nContract: https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x65Def5029A0e7591e46B38742bFEdd1Fb7b24436\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nKanpeki is an actual advancement in the Defi space and should attract a large amount of TVL on Fantom.

This will allow users to get the most beneficial conditions and the best possible results. \n\nThere is no commission for in and out! \n\nAnd it\u2019s actually as easy as that. Users will only need to add funds into a liquidity pair on the exchange and as they get LP tokens, entrust those to the DeHive Impulse smart contract. That\u2019s all. As soon as users enable automatic compounding in the smart contract, the platform will do everything on its own, creating a compound interest for your higher profit.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is that DeHive Impulse does not have any real access to users\u2019 funds, which enables higher security of the instrument.

Tired of animal tokens with no product or development work? Try getting in early on a proper token, built on the Arbitrum Network, which is a level 2 solution built on top of Ethereum. Arbitrum is only a week old, and already has over a billion dollars in value on the network, and CoffeeSwap will be the main swap for all of that capital.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCoffeeSwap is the very first native swap to launch on Arbitrum, meaning it has potential, via first mover advantage and good tokenomics, to become like a PancakeSwap of Arbitrum. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe CoffeeSwap token \u2013 called CoffeeBean (COFFEE) \u2013 has just gone live on SushiSwap on Arbitrum, but staking and farming launch today, at 5 p.m. UTC\/GMT time. COFFEE Rewards and APYs are expected to be very high (potentially even 5000% APY) for the first week of farming, but rewards will drop by 90% after the first week, so it pays to be early! The best part is, you don\u2019t even need to buy COFFEE, you can earn it via farming if you are early, and then watch it appreciate over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe CoffeeSwap team is competent and ambitious, and they have laid out exactly how the project will grow and evolve in the first month on their medium.

Extreme market push. Huge market cap in the making. Active market. Buy on Uniswap.\n\nIts main competitor, $ICE, had a $32 mil. market cap on 5 September. Two months later, on 5 November, $ICE hit an ATH of $695 mil. market cap.\n\nCurrently, on 17 November, $PILOT has a $56 mil. mcap. Can it grow to $1.3 bil mcap., in the same time span, in two months, on 17 January? I think it can. I will explain why.\n\n$PILOT and $ICE are automatic liquidity optimizers, but $PILOT has the advantage to be universal. This means LPs can provide liquidity for ANY Uniswap pair. $ICE has only a limited amount of about 20 set pools, while $PILOT can provide pools for an unlimited number of pairs. \n\nThe second biggest difference between $PILOT and $ICE is the Unipilot Index Fund. $PILOT takes a percentage of the fees earned by LPs and sends it to the Index Fund. The Index Fund will contain mainly blue chips. Users will be able to burn their $PILOT tokens, to have exposure to the Index Fund tokens. Why would people exchange their $PILOT for the Index Fund share of tokens? Because at some point, you might have $1000 in $PILOT tokens, but if you burn it, you could get $1500 worth of tokens from the Index Fund. So, you burn your $PILOT, claim your tokens from the Index Fund, and you can re-buy even more $PILOT. The Index Fund will work as a rising price floor for $PILOT. The Index Fund can pump $PILOT price, in these situations.\n\nIn addition, 78% of the supply will be burnt over 3 years, quarterly, by the team, including their own tokens! So, with all the burns done each time someone wants to get access to the Index Fund tokens, $PILOT has deflationary tokenomics.\n\nMainnet for $PILOT is set for 18th November. After mainnet, $PILOT has tons of updates planned: \n1. Cross chain \n2. Sushiswap Trident support \n3. xPILOT and $PILOT staking \n4. Flash fees & Index pools \n5. Interest free stable coin loans \n6. Locking liquidity solution on Uniswap v3 \n...and much more.\n\n$PILOT team is planning a so-called Vampire Attack on mainnet launch day, a lot of liquidity will be directed into protocol. So what is a Vampire Attack? The liquidity is basically sucked out of the first platform and moved into the second platform, hence the name. The first step of a Vampire Attack is to incentivise liquidity providers of another platform to stake their LP tokens, which represent supplied liquidity, to a new platform. It's what Sushiswap did with Uniswap.\n\nBecause $PILOT is the ONLY universal optimizer on the market, huge amounts of liquidity will come through the Pilot Protocol. The TVL and the Index Fund will grow accordingly, with tens or even hundreds of millions each month. The price of $PILOT will moon hard. Remember that it was fair launched, so there are no presalers or VCs to dump on you. The liquidity on Uniswap is huge (currently sitting at $20 mil.), so whales will be attracted to buy huge stacks of $PILOT.\n\nOne more thing, $PILOT has received an #Uniswap grant and passed with flying colors 3 independent audits. Hundreds of people were involved in testnet contests. I already saw the interface of their platform and the UI is simply amazing. I think you haven't seen anything yet. The best part of the price action for $PILOT will come after the mainnet. Farming will be launched in the same day with the mainnet launch.\n\nMost people wanted to see all those features working live before they buy $PILOT, so I assume after it will go live, they will FOMO buy it. Avoid the FOMO while you still can and buy a $PILOT bag now. $PILOT to $1200? Possibly. $PILOT to $600? Probably.\n\nYou can buy $PILOT on Uniswap.

Join their community!\n\n[https:\/\/t.me\/dogeprotocolcommunity](https:\/\/t.me\/dogeprotocolcommunity) \n\n**\ud83d\udcb2** **Doge Protocol** **\ud83d\udcb2**\n\nWebsite: [https:\/\/DogeProtocol.org](https:\/\/dogeprotocol.org\/)\n\nTwitter: [https:\/\/twitter.com\/DogeProtocol1](https:\/\/twitter.com\/DogeProtocol1)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **What is the** **$****Doge Protocol** **exactly?**\n\nDoge Protocol will be a combination of decentralized networks, smart contracts and\n\ndecentralized apps (dapps), that form the backbone of this decentralization\n\ninitiative. The primary component of Doge Protocol will be a quantum-resistant\n\nblockchain that supports smart contracts, side chains and is scalable in the number\n\nof transactions. \n\n**\ud83d\udc49 $Doge Protocol** **blockchain?**\n\nA robust and scalable blockchain will be required to serve as the backbone for executing the vision of Doge Protocol, upon which other building blocks can be developed. **This blockchain will become the first one to be quantum resistant, proof of stake with smart contract support**\n\n**\ud83d\udc49 Quantum Resistance?**\n\nWhitepaper: [https:\/\/github.com\/DogeProtocol\/Doge-Protocol-Whitepapers\/blob\/main\/Doge-Protocol-Blockchain-Quantum-Resistance-Whitepaper.pdf](https:\/\/github.com\/DogeProtocol\/Doge-Protocol-Whitepapers\/blob\/main\/Doge-Protocol-Blockchain-Quantum-Resistance-Whitepaper.pdf) \n\nThere is also a specific reason why this blockchain must be quantum-resistant. Due to the advent of quantum computers, there is an imminent threat to existing asymmetric encryption systems like RSA, ECDSA that are used to secure almost all the current blockchains. Using algorithms like Shor\u2019s (rapid integer factorization) and Grover\u2019s (quadratic mining speedup on Proof of Work systems), Quantum Computers can break current blockchains in different ways. One of the visions of the Doge Protocol is that it should be secure in the future as well.\n\nSecurity itself evolves over time, hence no algorithm should be deemed future proof, including current quantum-resistant algorithms. However, but from the current landscape, quantum computers are a viable threat to blockchains. Hence the vision is to build a blockchain that is resistant to currently known quantum computer threats and keep it evolving based on the changing security landscape. \n\n**\ud83d\udc8eTokenomics:**\n\n\ud83d\udccc Symbol: DogeP\n\nDoge Protocol was launched in a fair manner on the Ethereum Blockchain on September 1, 2021. There is no BSC token. 100% of the total supply was added to UniSwap and SushiSwap. The liquidty was locked in UniCrypt for 29 years. \n\nThe quantum resistant blockchain is under active development. 15% of the total supply of this blockchain will be allocated to DogeP token holders as part of mainnet launch. The process to get DogeP coins for token holders will be given before mainnet launch.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Total supply: 100 trillion.\n\n\ud83d\udcccThere was no presale or ICO.\n\n\ud83d\udcccThere was no dev team or founder allocation.\n\n\ud83d\udcb2 Deflationary: 0.1% burn on each transaction.\n\n\ud83d\udcb2 Maximum allowed tokens per account at launch: 0.99%\n\n**\ud83c\udf10Whitepaper done?

Sushi is tired of all these farmers not giving a fuck about governance and selling right away so they thought DRC could help. And if sushi wants to partner then its just a matter of time until the other platforms DRC is built on top of want the same.\n\nWhat to know about DRC:\n\n\\- Always earn a higher APY on LPs by staking through Dracula than on the underlying platform. How? Every day rewards are withdrawn, sold for ETH, and deposited into a Rari Capital auto-compounding ETH fund.\n\n\\- Earn more but also receive your rewards in ETH... or DRC if you like your shitcoins ;-) . If you select DRC it will market buy DRC aka increase the price.\n\n\\- Supply fixed at \\~13.8 million tokens\n\n\\- A couple of whales sold on the announcement went from $3 to right now $0.77 - overall # of holders went down by like 20 (verifiable on etherscan). How many < 15MM market cap coins have a partnership with a project like Sushi?\n\n\\- LPs it supports right now if you want to research moving yours over: Sushi, Dodo, Luaswap, and Pickle.

Pangolin brings you the best trading opportunities to find and maximize your yield.\n\nPangolin is a decentralized exchange (DEX) which runs on Avalanche, uses the **same automated market-making (AMM) model as Uniswap**, features a native governance token called PNG that is fully community distributed and is capable of trading all tokens issued on Ethereum and Avalanche. In a crowded marketplace with multiple contenders, Pangolin offers three critically important benefits: **fast and cheap trades**, **community-driven development**, and a **fair and open token distribution**.\n\nFirst, Pangolin can finalize trades quickly and cheaply. Since Pangolin is built on Avalanche, it enables users to swap assets while enjoying sub-second transaction finality and transaction fees as low as a few cents. Oftentimes, trades on Pangolin will feel as fast as trades on centralized exchanges. Second, beyond the significant performance upgrades to the technical status quo, Pangolin is community-driven. The native governance token, PNG, enables the community to drive the development of the product in full. Third, but not least, Pangolin features a 100% community-focused token distribution model, meaning that all tokens are distributed directly to the community, without any allocations to team, advisors, investors, or insiders.\n\nThe app, alongside the PNG mining and airdrop, will go live at 2PM ET [https:\/\/app.pangolin.exchange](https:\/\/app.pangolin.exchange\/)\n\nIn the meantime, users can prepare by reviewing tutorials here [https:\/\/pangolin.exchange\/tutorials](https:\/\/pangolin.exchange\/tutorials)\n\nBeyond performance upgrades, Pangolin\u2019s liquidity mining program enables liquidity providers to yield the native governance token, PNG, while collecting standard trading fees of .30%.\n\n100% of PNG will be distributed to the community, so there\u2019s no premine or any team tokens.","160":"Have you ever wondered what happens when a momma Inu meets a papa piece of Sushi?

The token is UNIDX. The platform shares 50% of all fees with holders, and all holders have to do is hold the token in their wallet. No staking required (though optional single-side staking is coming up to get\u00a0even more rewards). To evaluate the potential for yourself, check out the terminal yourself to get a sense of what it does (and how nice it looks compared to more popular competing projects, like DYDX). With a market cap of just **$4 million**, a doxxed team, and a fully\u00a0functioning product, it is only a matter of time before this undervalued project moons.\u00a0\n\nLinks: https:\/\/unidexbeta.app\/trading , https:\/\/unidex.exchange\/calculator.html , https:\/\/twitter.com\/UniDexFinance\n\n**Why the token price will increase:** It comes down to volume on the platform.\n\nThe daily volume on UniDex has been steadily rising\u00a0over the past 6 months, now approaching $1 million per day. So, if you hold 10,000 UNIDX tokens, that means you get about $4 per day. Not much. But if volume keeps uptrending over the next few months \u2014 say, $30 million a day, which is a relatively small number compared to large DEXes \u2014 then that same holding will net you ~$120 per day. (Of course, the long-term goal is to reach CEX-like trading volume at amounts over $1 billion per day, but just keeping things conservative for now.)\n\nIf the volume keeps the trend, many holders will logically choose to reinvest their rewards for more UNIDX, anticipating that they can greatly boost their future rewards by accumulating more of the token while it's cheap. (The token is sitting at $4 million MC.) As volume picks up, this will put steady buy pressure on the token from smart holders who want to boost future\u00a0rewards. So will the (optional) single-side staking: The terminal will auto buyback UNIDX tokens and distribute them to stakers, adding to the buy pressure and effectively taking tokens out of the circulating supply.\n\n**Why volume will increase:** In addition to the organic uptrend in volume from new users, UniDex is working with numerous partners who are integrating the terminal's API into their currently existing products. That means that much of the volume on those already-popular projects will be transferred through UniDex, boosting the daily rewards for holders. With more integrations, the volume will only continue to grow. To estimate the future potential of the project for yourself, I'd suggest going to the terminal and checking out how it routes and aggregates your orders, and comparing those same trades on other projects. See for yourself if using it could save you money, and then look into the existing projects who are actively incorporating\u00a0UniDex tech into their own products.\nOther products that will add to volume: Leverage on Fantom,\u00a0an extremely efficient auto harvester and compounder, exotic trading pairs, and an upcoming \"simple mode\" for beginner traders. More information on the platform's Medium page: https:\/\/unidexfinance.medium.com\/?p=bf9f1bc24bcf\n\n**Background**: UniDex is a working trading terminal that aims to bring a best-in-class trading experience to DeFi. One of the biggest problems in DeFi trading right now lies in fragmentation and a lack of tools that experienced traders need: charting, limit orders, advanced analytics, and a polished interface.\n\u00a0\nThe terminal has been operational for about a year, during which it's launched its unique aggregator\/routing technology on more than 20 chains. UniDex takes a no-bias approach in terms of routing: Rather than just picking \"the best\" dex for your order, UniDex will find the most efficient path every time, which might mean splitting your order so that 60% goes through SushiSwap, 20% through SpiritSwap, and 20% through Beethovenx. Over time, the fees traders save add up \u2014 in some cases, this kind of efficient routing can save you thousands in USD value on a trade.\u00a0","178":"Sushi left ETH due to the high fees.\n\nAVAX crypto will be used for trading which will increase the value of AVAX\n\n[https:\/\/medium.com\/avalancheavax\/sushiswap-launches-on-avalanche-bringing-another-leading-dex-to-avalanches-growing-defi-ecosystem-8b84e966251f](https:\/\/medium.com\/avalancheavax\/sushiswap-launches-on-avalanche-bringing-another-leading-dex-to-avalanches-growing-defi-ecosystem-8b84e966251f)","179":"WELCOME TO BANKSY NFT! \ud83c\udf88\n\nBANKSY NFT WILL BE THE LEADING NFT MARKETPLACE\n\nLOW SUPPLY EASY X100 THIS WEEK\n\nBanksy NFT is a new token on Binance Smart Chain network that includes many useful features that all investors love so much!

Flame Token is the native currency of Sharesome, the first social discovery network for adult content creators and brands. Sharesome is designed to connect all stakeholders in the adult industry.  \n \n\nThe team behind Flame did a lot of things different from usual crypto projects. For example, they build the utility before they launched the token. Now, Flame has already 1.6M monthly active user. You want to know more? Visit [https:\/\/flametoken.io\/](https:\/\/flametoken.io\/)\n\n**How does this work?**  **\ud83d\udcad**    \n Think of Sharesome as a mix between Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit \u2013 without the hate-speech, but with the nudes. Sharesome has already 1.6M monthly active users and 500M monthly post views. Already, every month 30M paid posts are sold, generating a monthly revenue of 700.000 XFL.

The multiple locks were to help keep the hoes feeling safe about their money. Development is shaping up real fine.

One time my hoe came back to my corner and said someone stole my money. At first I thought the bitch was lying but she had a black eye and a busted lip. I thought to myself \"Oh hell no!\" So I got with another cat (who was an ex-pimp) he had experience being a developer. We decided to come up with Hooker Cash and change the world for Pimps and Hoes.

The primary component of Doge Protocol will be a quantum-resistant\n\nblockchain that supports smart contracts, side chains and is scalable in the number\n\nof transactions. \n\n**\ud83d\udc49 $Doge Protocol** **blockchain?**\n\nA robust and scalable blockchain will be required to serve as the backbone for executing the vision of Doge Protocol, upon which other building blocks can be developed. **This blockchain will become the first one to be quantum resistant, proof of stake with smart contract support**\n\n**\ud83d\udc49 Quantum Resistance?**\n\nWhitepaper: [https:\/\/github.com\/DogeProtocol\/Doge-Protocol-Whitepapers\/blob\/main\/Doge-Protocol-Blockchain-Quantum-Resistance-Whitepaper.pdf](https:\/\/github.com\/DogeProtocol\/Doge-Protocol-Whitepapers\/blob\/main\/Doge-Protocol-Blockchain-Quantum-Resistance-Whitepaper.pdf) \n\nThere is also a specific reason why this blockchain must be quantum-resistant. Due to the advent of quantum computers, there is an imminent threat to existing asymmetric encryption systems like RSA, ECDSA that are used to secure almost all the current blockchains. Using algorithms like Shor\u2019s (rapid integer factorization) and Grover\u2019s (quadratic mining speedup on Proof of Work systems), Quantum Computers can break current blockchains in different ways. One of the visions of the Doge Protocol is that it should be secure in the future as well.\n\nSecurity itself evolves over time, hence no algorithm should be deemed future proof, including current quantum-resistant algorithms. However, but from the current landscape, quantum computers are a viable threat to blockchains. Hence the vision is to build a blockchain that is resistant to currently known quantum computer threats and keep it evolving based on the changing security landscape. \n\n**\ud83d\udc8eTokenomics:**\n\n\ud83d\udccc Symbol: DogeP\n\nDoge Protocol was launched in a fair manner on the Ethereum Blockchain on September 1, 2021.

This will allow users to get the most beneficial conditions and the best possible results. \n\nThere is no commission for in and out! \n\nAnd it\u2019s actually as easy as that.

In fact, gas prices can be said to be the reason why ERC-20 low caps and especially community tokens have been having such a tough time lately \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly why ArbiDoge is such a big deal.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArbiDoge is the first community token to launch on Arbitrum, launching last night and already going viral. This is a historic token, and it\u2019s a perfect introduction for people to test on Arbitum and see just how cheap and fast the transactions are.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArbiDoge was my first introduction to Arbitrum and I can't tell you how impressed I am with how fast and effective everything is - it's honestly the best chain I've ever used, and I can totally see how it will allow Etherium to finally scale.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe hype for Arbitrum has transferred over to ArbiDoge, and I haven\u2019t seen a community this engaged and active since the height of meme coin season in April. The token already hit a 6 mil mcap on the strength of the community alone, which is a 400x up from launch. It\u2019s now in a bit of a pull back to 3 mil mcap with lots of early whales out and replaced by a sea of smaller fish as we prepare for the next leg, making it the perfect time to get in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team is also currently working on the website, which should be up either tonight or tomorrow. They\u2019re also in talks with CoinGecko to get the token listed as soon as the site is live, and are hinting at a few surprises in terms of functionality. It\u2019s amazing that this grew so fast without even a website or a way to track the token yet (graphs and info are available on the TG for now).\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith the strength of the community, I could see this being a project where the community grows extremely fast at first, and from there it continues to evolve grow a la SHIB.

I have been following since their original, now postponed presale, was listed.\n\n\\----\n\n**Preface on DeChart:**\u00a0DeChart was created for decentralized exchange traders who need a better way to chart any asset to make the most informed, efficient trades. DeChart is a next-generation data platform and community governed DAO built for DEX traders. As traders ourselves, we needed a better solution for charting nascent assets on any blockchain protocol or exchange. DeChart provides a better suite for users to chart and trade multiple assets at once with up to 8 charts on a flexible dashboard per browser window...\n\n[https:\/\/app.dechart.io](https:\/\/app.dechart.io\/)\n\n\\----\n\n**Since Launch:**\u00a0DeChart anons came out of stealth three days ago and received criticism for their listing on DxSale and anonymity (they are a DAO, anonymity is not uncommon), many in Telegram saying the project was a rug and that there was no product. They mainly received\u00a0**criticism for the 5000 softcap \/ 7800 hardcap in BNB \\~ which in USD is approximately $2.8-4.4M at $575 per BNB**. Liquidity was also a hot topic in the group, with 51% being locked until June 1st 2021 and then 25% until June 1st 2024.\n\n**They launched their product on time and it works as they said it would**, I personally love it and it has made charting multiple BSC tokens easy and less a cluttered mess of browser tabs. When support for other DEXs\/protocols come (Uniswap in May), I think DeChart is going to be a game changer and DCH is the next MOONSHOT!\n\nTeam has also been listening to users in chat, getting a CertiK audit when users were unhappy with Techrate and even committing to add technical features suggested by Telegram community.\n\nYesterday DxSale's servers went down starting before their presale. The team had already stated that if the sale did not meet the softcap they would go to another launchpad. After 8 or so hours with the presale down, they announced the DxSale was cancelled and that they are moving to another launchpad in the coming days.\u00a0**Users are suggesting Unicrypt and they also said they are getting interest from top launchpads.**\n\nI'm not sure about this, but someone said the DxSale was a PR stunt, I'm starting to believe it and that this is going to be huge they went from 50 telegram to nearly 500 now in a few days and dont seem to do much marketing yet.\n\n\\---\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\n**MC Comp (Apr. 30th, 2021)**\n\nDEXT MC - $56.8M (non-diluted)\n\nPOO MC - $37.0M (fully diluted)\n\nBOG MC - $34.9M (fully diluted)\n\nGOSWAPP MC - $12.0M (fully diluted)\n\n**DCH MC at** **PRESALE** **(est. on presale figures) - (*****$6.6M*** **non-diluted)**\n\n**DCH Token**\n\nDCH has some pretty interesting features. You can stake the token to earn rewards and participate in governance, I am sure there will be some benefits for stakers when premium features start to rollout.\n\nWhat I found to be really cool is that\u00a0**all revenues from the DeChart platform are going to buy back DCH**\u00a0from the open market which send directly to the community treasury.\n\nThis implies that **as long as the platform exists and is making revenues, there will tokens for the community to decide to reward\/add new features\/burn every month.**\n\n**Team tokens are locked up for 12 months**\u00a0and released on a per block basis from\u00a0[Sablier.Finance](https:\/\/sablier.finance\/)\u00a0(platform for sending payments over time)\n\n**Main take aways**\n\nThe developers are clearly committed to delivering a superior data and charting product for DeFi users and any DEX\/Protocol.

This is another thing that is not uncommon with DAOs or governance tokens, selling a larger % proportionate to max supply to get voting power into the hands of stakeholders. It is a large sum, but seemingly more fair when considering it will be turned over to stakeholders in the end.\n\nI could be wrong, but this seems like\u00a0**one of the biggest opportunities of 2021**\u00a0and I will definitely be participating in the presale when they announce it.\n\nCheck out the app and join the telegram!\n\n[app.dechart.io](https:\/\/app.dechart.io\/)\n\n[t.me\/dechart](https:\/\/t.me\/dechart)\n\n**Here is their introduction:**\n\n\\---\n\n**DeChart was created for decentralized exchange traders who need a better way to chart any asset to make the most informed, efficient trades.**\n\nDeChart is a next-generation data platform and community governed DAO built for DEX traders. As traders ourselves, we needed a better solution for charting nascent assets on any blockchain protocol or exchange. DeChart provides a better suite for users to chart and trade multiple assets at once with up to 8 charts on a flexible dashboard per browser window. Our feature set includes hot pairs, user portfolio (i.e. link wallet MetaMask or any mobile wallet), click to swap, multi charts and many other highly useful or exclusive tools. DeChart uses locally hosted nodes to index blockchain protocols, this ensures DeChart has the most recent data for all tokens, and hot pairs based on a set of demand metrics. DeChart has support for PancakeSwap immediately at launch with Uniswap (v2 & v3), SushiSwap, and others soon to follow. DeChart will also offer charting for traditionally traded assets, like Apple or Tesla stock, very shortly after launch.\n\nTo read more about DeChart and the DCH token visit our first article on\u00a0[docs.dechart.io](http:\/\/docs.dechart.io\/)\n\nTelegram Community:\u00a0[t.me\/dechart](https:\/\/www.t.me\/dechart)\n\nTelegram Announcements:\u00a0[t.me\/dechartannouncements](https:\/\/www.t.me\/dechartannouncements)\n\nFollow us on Twitter:\u00a0[https:\/\/twitter.com\/DeChart\\_io](https:\/\/twitter.com\/DeChart_io)\n\nDocuments:\u00a0[docs.dechart.io](https:\/\/www.docs.dechart.io\/)","207":"Alright, let\u2019s get the shilly part out of the way\u2026 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a stable, long-term investment with a utility backbone, you\u2019ll want to pick up some bags of Dogira. The work Eoghan and the rest of the dev team are doing will add some viable competition to a corner that ENJIN has mostly covered on their own. \n\nThe latest AMA has a lot of good info about what I\u2019m going to talk about below, so make sure you give it a watch if what I have to say is intriguing to you. Let\u2019s go! \n\nSo, I said it: Bear Markets are good for everyone. \n\nIf you \u201clost\u201d your massive gains, don\u2019t worry. They\u2019ll be back. Bear Markets actually serve a very important function. Most of the projects we know and love today were found in these market turns. Why?\n\nBecause in bullruns all the moonbois and coin-flippers are looking for fast money. It inflates prices and then they get dumped on, hard. But during down market it gives a chance for serious projects to shine. \n\nSee, the issue with massive bullruns is that when everyone is looking for the hot new thing, they\u2019re missing the diamonds. However, instead of it being a thing about diamonds in the rough, it\u2019s more like trying to find a diamond in an Arctic shelf. \n\nBulls mean multi-trillion circulated coins are great for 1000x shots. Bears mean that multi-million token supplies are far more preferable. It\u2019s how ENJIN, Sushi, Solana, and other huge projects started gaining their traction. \n\nDogira had a huge shakeout of flakey money, and we\u2019re drawing real long-term investors. It\u2019s why our price remains unshakable right now. It\u2019s lower than we\u2019d like (hovering around 5 cents\/Dogira), but it\u2019s an ironclad wall of investors who believe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoin us, and experience the benefits of investing when it\u2019s Bear, so you can successfully thrive on the Bull. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pick up your coins on Uniswap](https:\/\/app.uniswap.org\/#\/swap?outputCurrency=0x4b86e0295e7d32433ffa6411b82b4f4e56a581e1&use=V2) while gas is cheap cheap cheap!","208":"*Finally, A project that will bring DeFi to the masses!*\n\nSound Familiar?\n\nWe're certainly not the first to make this claim, but Liquidis will be the first to deliver.

However, still there is no easy to use application on the market that solves this problem. At Liquidus this is what we want to change and we are glad that we\u2019ve been able to put a great team together, consisting of 10 experienced crypto investors, entrepreneurs & developers.\n\n**What\u2019s the next step for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?**\n\nWe believe that the entire traditional banking sector will be replaced by blockchain technology and DeFi protocols over the next years. Monetary transactions and banking won\u2019t be processed any longer by centralised banks and their servers but will be transitioned to run on blockchains that can be accessed by DeFi protocols.\n\nHowever, current difficulties of the DeFi market are that it is very complex to non-crypto affine users to use Dapps and take loans or to allocate funds to all the different platforms in order to earn interest.\n\n*When you are reading this article, you are probably an early adopter of crypto and DeFi. You\u2019ve been accessing various different DeFi protocols using their Dapps and connected your wallet to those pages in our browser. We don\u2019t hope it, but you might have lost some funds on the way when there was a project exploited or for another reason. You know, to use DeFi you have to know your stuff. Otherwise lost of funds can happen easily.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Liquidus will be the first native app for iOS and Android that provides a secure and easy-to-use wallet with access to all major projects cross-chain.**\n\nOur vision is to provide a one stop shop solution that gives users access to all of the leading DeFi projects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Make swaps using our integrated swap feature with automatic cross-chain capability. For example, swap ETH that you are holding on Ethereum and receive CAKE on the Binance Smart Chain.\n2. Access your liquidity pools & farms with one click. With Liquidus you can create new liquidity pools or deposit LP tokens to a farm with one single click. Imagine having one app that integrates all major DEXes like PancakeSwap, ApeSwap, QuickSwap, SushiSwap, UniSwap, etc.\n3. Don\u2019t worry about the safety of your funds. With Liquidus all transactions made are protected by an insurance provider.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Liquidus KeyPoints:**\n\n1. No tax on transactions \n\n2. In process of registering a legal entity in a crypto friendly jurisdiction \n\n3. The Liquidus success will fall solely within the development of the app - they have a team member on board who has previously built a top 10 app within its own niche (given a lot of confidence) \n\n4. They will have an insurance fund covering all of the transactions users make within the network \n\n5. They will offer the ability to utilise loans on your crypto assets \n\n6. They will be used multi chain across the entire crypto market\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis, when the APP will start to work, will blow very hard.","220":"Hello gem hunters, I keep searching new gem coins and I found a big potential in the market.

The website says it can \u201callow users to get the best price from the biggest DEXs - Kyber, Uniswap, Bancor, SushiSwap, Airswap, Synthetix, Compound (to name a few).\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI LIKE THE TOKEN:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-  DEXs are the future and trading on DEX aggregators is often preferable to using individual DEXs, especially with larger transactions. I can\u2019t see any mention of KYC on the site. If they add KYC they project will fail but they don\u2019t need to from what I have seen and they surely know this.\n\n\\-  The token looks heavily meme-able like it\u2019s Wall St bets \/ 4chan. This has the potential to turn into a cult platform if they deliver and can get the ape community element right. The token will probably do some nice multiples on the meme value alone but the big gains will come when they start running ApeDex  (they call it a DEX, its an aggregator  \u2013 but ok).\n\n\\-  Tokenomics look similar to the other coins that have done well this year \u2013 SafeMoon, Feg, Shib. All of these are real projects that have deflationary tokenomics and this looks like another one.\n\n\\-  Gut instinct. It\u2019s been a crazy year and this token has a nice mix of memery and a sensible product that people will use. \n\nCATALYST:\n\n\\-  Very little publicity on the token at the moment. Some marketing required to get this on people\u2019s  radars.\n\n\\-  Release of further information about ApeDex will likely move the token.\n\n\\-  Release of the ApeDex (apparently in July) will move the token significantly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCOMPARISONS:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMetaMask (high 0.875% fees, making  50-100k per day apparently), ShapeShift (FOX token marketcap swings from 500m to 1b), : Changelly (2.5m monthly visitors, rev unknown), Coinswitch (2.5m monthly visitors, not sure on revenue),.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nESTIMATE:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt time of writing the market cap is around $1 mil. Really hard to predict but I can see this going into XXXm market cap in the coming months. Broader market conditions may move that higher or lower.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUNKNOWNS:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes the platform require KYC? If so I will exit immediately.\n\nMore clarification on the actual platform required.\n\nMore clarification on ApeDex fee structure required.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRISK WARNING: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe crypto market is obviously volatile at the moment. Alt coins in general are highly susceptible to the broader crypto and economic environment. Risk is also opportunity, place your bets accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nI hold APED.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https:\/\/apetoken.com](https:\/\/apetoken.com)\n\nTG: [https:\/\/t.me\/TheApeTokenOfficial](https:\/\/t.me\/TheApeTokenOfficial)","226":"\u263c Ulti Arena is aiming to be the largest Gaming and NFT Market space of 2021.

At **Liquidus** this is what they want to change, and they are glad that they've been able to put a great team together, consisting of 10 experienced crypto investors, entrepreneurs & developers all with the vision to make this a reality.\n\n**What\u2019s the next step for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?**\n\nThey believe (and me included!)  that the entire traditional banking sector will be replaced by blockchain technology and DeFi protocols over the next years. Monetary transactions and banking won\u2019t be processed any longer by centralised banks and their servers but will be transitioned to run on blockchains that can be accessed by DeFi protocols.\n\nHowever, current difficulties of the DeFi market are that it is very complex to non-crypto affine users to use Dapps and take loans or to allocate funds to all the different platforms in order to earn interest.\n\n*If you are reading this article, you are probably an early adopter of crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ve been accessing various different DeFi protocols using their Dapps and connected your wallet to those pages in your browser. But not everyone is in the same position and some people will and do find the Defi space a complex minefield. This can sometimes lead to people losing funds and then in turn becoming switched off to Defi and the crypto space.*\n\n**Liquidus will be the first native app for iOS and Android that provides a secure and easy-to-use wallet with access to all major projects cross-chain.**\n\nThe vision is to provide a one stop shop solution that gives users access to all of the leading DeFi projects.\n\n1. Make swaps using our integrated swap feature with automatic cross-chain capability. For example, swap ETH that you are holding on Ethereum and receive CAKE on the Binance Smart Chain.\n2. Access your liquidity pools & farms with one click. With Liquidus you can create new liquidity pools or deposit LP tokens to a farm with one single click. Imagine having one app that integrates all major DEXes like PancakeSwap, ApeSwap, QuickSwap, SushiSwap, UniSwap, etc.\n3. Don\u2019t worry about the safety of your funds.

DeChart is a next-generation data platform and community governed DAO built for DEX traders. As traders ourselves, we needed a better solution for charting nascent assets on any blockchain protocol or exchange. DeChart provides a better suite for users to chart and trade multiple assets at once with up to 8 charts on a flexible dashboard per browser window...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/app.dechart.io](https:\/\/app.dechart.io)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Since Launch**: DeChart anons came out of stealth three days ago and received criticism for their listing on DxSale and anonymity (they are a DAO, anonymity is not uncommon), many in Telegram saying the project was a rug and that there was no product. They mainly received criticism for the 5000 softcap \/ 7800 hardcap in BNB \\~ which in USD is approximately $2.8-4.4M at $575 per BNB. Liquidity was also a hot topic in the group, with 51% being locked until June 1st 2021 and then 25% until June 1st 2024.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey launched their product on time and it works as they said it would, I personally love it and it has made charting multiple BSC tokens easy and less a cluttered mess of browser tabs. When support for other DEXs\/protocols come (Uniswap in May), I think DeChart is going to be a game changer and DCH is the next MOONSHOT!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeam has also been listening to users in chat, getting a CertiK audit when users were unhappy with Techrate and even committing to add technical features suggested by Telegram community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday DxSale's servers went down starting before their presale. The team had already stated that if the sale did not meet the softcap they would go to another launchpad. After 8 or so hours with the presale down, they announced the DxSale was cancelled and that they are moving to another launchpad in the coming days. Users are suggesting Unicrypt and they also said they are getting interest from top launchpads.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure about this, but someone said the DxSale was a PR stunt, I'm starting to believe it and that this is going to be huge they went from 50 telegram to nearly 500 now in a few days and dont seem to do much marketing yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTechnical Analysis:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMC Comp (Apr. 30th, 2021)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDEXT MC - $56.8M (non-diluted)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPOO MC - $37.0M (fully diluted)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBOG MC - $34.9M (fully diluted)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGOSWAPP MC - $12.0M (fully diluted)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDCH MC at PRESALE \\*\\*(est. on presale figures) - (\\*\\*$6.6M non-diluted)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDCH Token\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDCH has some pretty interesting features. You can stake the token to earn rewards and participate in governance, I am sure there will be some benefits for stakers when premium features start to rollout.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I found to be really cool is that all revenues from the DeChart platform are going to buy back DCH from the open market which send directly to the community treasury.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis implies that as long as the platform exists and is making revenues, there will tokens for the community to decide to reward\/add new features\/burn every month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeam tokens are locked up for 12 months and released on a per block basis from [Sablier.Finance](https:\/\/Sablier.Finance) (platform for sending payments over time)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMain take aways\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe developers are clearly committed to delivering a superior data and charting product for DeFi users and any DEX\/Protocol. Im sure the other features in the timeline are going to add a ton of value along the way as well if they are anywhere near the quality of the charting app. There is huge potential, imagine if users voted in a launchpad - This could go to 100-250M MC in the end or higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could be wrong, but this seems like one of the biggest opportunities of 2021 and I will definitely be participating in the presale when they announce it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck out the app and join the telegram!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[app.dechart.io](https:\/\/app.dechart.io)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[t.me\/dechart](https:\/\/t.me\/dechart)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is their introduction:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeChart was created for decentralized exchange traders who need a better way to chart any asset to make the most informed, efficient trades.  \n\n\nDeChart is a next-generation data platform and community governed DAO built for DEX traders.

DeChart provides a better suite for users to chart and trade multiple assets at once with up to 8 charts on a flexible dashboard per browser window. Our feature set includes hot pairs, user portfolio (i.e. link wallet MetaMask or any mobile wallet), click to swap, multi charts and many other highly useful or exclusive tools. DeChart uses locally hosted nodes to index blockchain protocols, this ensures DeChart has the most recent data for all tokens, and hot pairs based on a set of demand metrics.

I\u2019m confident it will provide similar returns to other NFT platforms like:\n \n - **$THETA (+7467% 1Y)** \n - **$CHZ (+5321% 1Y)** \n - **$ENJ (+1551% 1Y)**\n \n[https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/doki-doki-finance](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/doki-doki-finance\/)\n \n## What is DOKI?\n \nDoki Doki is a gamified NFT marketplace based on Japanese \u201cGachapon\u201d machine\u2019s (popular toy vending machines that dispense branded collectibles randomly) Doki currently has an insane amount of artistic and development work already on display and a lot of \u201cpumpable\u201d announcements and timeline events over the next year. Doki Doki Finance is not a project that can easily be emulated.\n \nThe general concept of DOKI is that users insert ETH or AZUKI **($AZUKI is earned by staking $DOKI)** tokens into a themed virtual vending machine that dispenses NFT\u2019s with an element of chance. It\u2019s estimated by community members that the supply of AZUKI could be **conservatively reduced by over 45.5%** in the next year alone, classing it as a hyperdeflationary token. There is currently **over $500k of ETH in the team vault ready to rebuy DOKI** from the market. \n \nCollaborations for this are potentially endless, big names announced already are **SushiSwap**, **Pranksy** (#1 Opensea seller) + lot\u2019s more on the way. To increase utility for $DOKI, the team have built an original NFT game called Chainbinders, which included a $DOKI buyback from the $10m funds raised.\n \nTrust me, once you pair your wallet and experiment with the machines you will see what I mean and how **big artists, cryptos and brands will easily be able to use DOKI** to enter the NFT arena. The current machines have users spinning on average 30-40 times trying to get rare items or a full set of NFT\u2019s from the current brands.\n \nThere is huge technical, biz dev and creative work being frequently shared with the community such as L2 support (bye fees!), new games always being announced and lots of liquidity + trading improvements being added. The team seems very on the ball and are aiming to announce NFT staking of DOKI assets using uncily soon.\n \n## Why $DOKI token?\n \nProjects in the same arena are sitting in the billion $ marketcap club currently, DOKI just has a $8m mc at time of writing. $DOKI is fully deflationary and has so many revenue streams\u2026 let\u2019s explore!\n \nThe total NFT marketcap is over $30 billion currently and the physical Gachapon industry is worth $3+ billion a year in Asia, this is the WAY cooler, decentralized future of Gachapon and NFT distribution. The entire DOKI supply is currently circulating with a zero team token allocation, providing an ultra fair distribution with no chance of dev dump.\n \nIf you stake DOKI, you receive passive income with the platform\u2019s utility token AZUKI ($ 7.5m mc currently.)  AZUKI is burned in DeGacha machines and at a rate of 5% per transaction, making the token highly deflationary. There is a fantastic analysis of token supply and price impact for *$DOKI \/ $AZUKI* by community member \u201cSalamanca\u201d in their Telegram channel (search \u201cAZUKI token pool supply analysis.PDF\u201d)\n \nKey takeaways from the research are:\n \n* Estimated Q4 2021 **supply reduction -45.5%**\n* Resultant **price pressure q4 2021 +40.45%**\n* Current price for **$AZUKI: $0.72** - **Proforma price Q4 2021 $3.46**\n \nThese figures are **supply\u2010side price effects only**, not demand side which I anticipate to be far far higher. By staking Doki  you\u2019re generating an asset ($AZUKI) which has hefty burn mechanics due to a real, proven use-case...not an artificially inflated digital ponzi scheme (cough.)\n \nDOKI is the governance and revenue sharing token for the platform, **$DOKI holders receive 15% of all ETH generated in games via buybacks**. This is absolutely huge and can push the token into the tens of thousands VERY quickly. $100k+ of revenue has already been generated in the last few months with the ultra-high gas prices. Wait until L2 with Matic which basically makes fees close to non-existent.\n \nDue to a small supply of 50,000, I am acquiring as much DOKI as possible while also buying AZUKI at a 90\/10 ratio.\n \nIt\u2019s very clear from the project's socials and accomplishments so far, they have an outstanding grasp on both marketing and community. Community wins the war.\n \n**I believe a 5x+ in the next 1\/8 weeks to be very possible based on the seriously dizzying speed of development, NFT hype and on the announcement of more big artist collaborations.**\n \n**Long term goals: By even just capturing micro percentages of the existing and future NFT marketplaces\/Gachapon industry, easily puts this token as a \u201cmillionaire maker\u201d 20-50x+ shot like THETA and CHZ.**\n \n \n$DOKI is currently available on Uniswap and Linkswap.\n \n \n**Key links:**\n \n[https:\/\/twitter.com\/dokidokifinance](https:\/\/twitter.com\/dokidokifinance)\n \n[https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/doki-doki-finance](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/doki-doki-finance\/)\n \n[https:\/\/t.me\/ddnfg](https:\/\/t.me\/ddnfg)\n \n[https:\/\/degacha.com](https:\/\/degacha.com\/machines)","256":"Plasma is an Ethereum Protocol that allows you to stake your assets and get optimized yield.

[Partnered with Comethswap](https:\/\/medium.com\/@dokidoki.finance\/doki-x-cometh-more-lp-rewards-on-l2-spaceship-gacha-8918d549b4ce) to provide [multiple rewards for liquidity mining](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MUSTCometh\/status\/1386657788970024963) ($DOKI\/$AZUKI + $MUST as rewards for staking liquidity, and soon will include [$uDOKI](https:\/\/www.app.unic.ly\/#\/utoken-contract\/0x7e6c38d007740931e4b419bf15a68c79a0fb0c66) for a total of 3 rewards for staking LP for a single token) on [Comethswap](https:\/\/swap.cometh.io\/#\/stake), but even plans to provide a degacha machine for containing unique NFT space ships usable in [Cometh's game](https:\/\/www.cometh.io\/) (as a summary, the game has you *mining* asteroids by remaining in close proximity to them, yielding various ERC-20 tokens such as $USDC\/$DAI, $ETH, and others.)\n2. [Partnered with SushiSwap](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SushiSwap\/status\/1386683285783269376), yup that's right, the very same top 100 DEX. One of the degacha machines will feature art from SushiSwap's own visual designer, [Kastrye](https:\/\/forum.sushiswapclassic.org\/t\/team-proposal-kastrye-visual-designer\/2056).\n3. [One of the only two (currently) whitelisted pools](https:\/\/www.app.unic.ly\/#\/farm) on [Unic.ly](https:\/\/Unic.ly), which is only given to the projects which show adequate use of the platform (ranked based on liquidity provided, not market cap) *and* was decided by a community vote, [which tied with Aavegotchi](https:\/\/t.me\/unicly_community\/11755).\n\nIf the above does not convince you of the true potential of [DokiDoki.Finance](https:\/\/DokiDoki.Finance) just yet, take a look at the artists that released on [https:\/\/degacha.com\/](https:\/\/degacha.com\/). There is true variety there, and it is not just around anime-styled art, if that isn't your thing. Top-tier NFT artists such as [SeerLight](https:\/\/twitter.com\/seerlight) ([degacha machine](https:\/\/degacha.com\/playgacha\/3\/0x49d48510f29e4767A71467097F5018f7B2DA0449)), [TokyoLuv](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TokyoLuv) ([degacha machine](https:\/\/degacha.com\/playgacha\/3\/0x70694D4ac4dE4B1DC40Bf9108361Ce96faa460d0)), and NFT curators such as [PranksyNFT](https:\/\/twitter.com\/pranksyNFT) ([degacha machine](https:\/\/degacha.com\/playgacha\/3\/0x26e3279BbD60f9e5C44cdE65fa0811a389f1bb8C)). Don't know who any of these people are? Neither did I, but their following (10K+, one with 50K+) should speak volumes, and its only just begun.\n\nHopefully, you are at least still reading, and if so, great, now listen to the real sales pitch here. [Chainbinders](https:\/\/chainbinders.degacha.com\/game-theory) provides some actual innovative and novel ideas that I hope more projects can capitalize on in the future. In Chainbinders, 75% of the $ETH used to [mint](https:\/\/chainbinders.degacha.com\/mint) the one-off currency, $BND, is kept in a *reserve pool*. This reserve pool is essentially a pot of gold that gets distributed back to the community and can be collected by *burning* NFTs, providing instant on-demand liquidity. It would be somewhat boring if that were it, so there is a catch: Each subsequent burned NFT provides more than the last, and so the game boils down to \"How long do I want to wait to burn my NFT?\" in which case you have two choices: Burn your NFT sooner for a quick cash-in or wait for others to burn their NFTs to increase your pay-out. It could be the difference between getting 1 ETH for a legendary NFT, or 100 ETH for the very same legendary NFT burned later. If you do not want to wait but want to make more money, you could possibly even sell the NFT on the secondary market like OpenSea, where perhaps you could get as much as 10 ETH from a more patient buyer going for the big cheese. More information about the token can be seen [here](https:\/\/chainbinders.degacha.com\/token). Sell quickly to try to make money during the current bull run, or hold throughout the bear market to get more than anyone else, is up to you. Just know that once $BND is spent, it is burned entirely, and hence $BND could also be sold on a secondary market (UniSwap liquidity will be provided) for an even safer flip. The price is capped at $15 per $BND, but is fitted to a pseudo-bonding curve, so a minimum of a 2x is likely if you wish to flip $BND.\n\nThere are only 3 days left, and the reason it only has had 8.7M TVL (despite being featured in multiple articles: \\[[1](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/nft-collecting-game-chainbinders-by-doki-doki-raises-5-million-in-under-two-hours-301267540.html),[2](https:\/\/bitcoinist.com\/nft-game-chainbinders-by-doki-doki-raised-5-million-in-under-two-hours\/),[3](https:\/\/www.fxstreet.com\/cryptocurrencies\/news\/gacha-systems-and-game-theory-can-transform-nfts-for-the-better-202104181420)\\]) is due to the fact that low caps have been bleeding rather heavily due to the influx of meme coins and FUD around capital gains tax. Oh yeah, the remaining 25% of the ETH raised goes to fund the marketing and the 50+ people who worked on the project.\n\nWhether you believe in the project or not, some cash can be made here, buying $BND to A) sell on the secondary market for quick gains, B) spin for NFTs and selling on OpenSea, C) spin for NFTs and wait to unbind now or later.\n\n**Previous Thread (removed due to need to edit\/correct $MUSE to $MUST):** [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoMoonShots\/comments\/mz3wvn\/dokidokifinances\\_chainbinders\\_nfts\\_with\\_instant\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoMoonShots\/comments\/mz3wvn\/dokidokifinances_chainbinders_nfts_with_instant\/)","265":"Hello everyone, welcome to SushiDogeMoon!\n\nThis is a chance x1000 times and go to the moon with SushiDogeMoon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Project overview\n\n  \ud83d\udccc50% Whitelist+ liquidity\n\n  \ud83d\udccc30% Burn of total supply\n\n  \ud83d\udccc15% Airdrop\n\n  \ud83d\udccc3% Marketing\n\n  \ud83d\udccc1% Wallet Dev\n\n  \ud83d\udccc1% Charity Wallet\n\n\n\ud83d\udd12 LP Locked \n\n \ud83d\udd25 30% Burn of total supply \n\n \ud83d\ude80 5% Buyback \u26a1\ufe0f\n\n \ud83d\udccc 5% Rewards to Holders\n\n\ud83d\udea8 2% automatically added to liquidity\n\n\ud83d\udc0bANTI WHALE\n\n\nWe are a new meme token of the Doge family and try to become a new BabyDoge or something like that.

Just invest in projects that are fixing what is broken. The end. LOL.\n\nBut seriously, let\u2019s take a look at these huge problems before solving them.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know, yield farming is 1. a whale game, and the constant dumping of tokens with 2. a relatively small liquidity causes small projects to be dumped close to zero. The classic \u2018they come, they eat, they leave\u2019.\n\nNaturally, it is a good thing when a project is not anything special \u2014 bad projects don\u2019t deserve long-term price appreciation.\n\nYet, we\u2019ve seen projects with extremely high-quality development and technology being dumped in the beginning and then rise from the ashes. They are now solving these problems even if the token price during early days dumped to close to $100K market cap.\n\nWas that enough warm-up for you? Here we go, let's fix the problems.\n\n# PART 1: DESTROY (or tame) THE WHALES\n\nTokens represent governance. One governance token governs one ecosystem, right? For example, **SushiSwap** governance happens through **SUSHI** tokens. If you want to be part of several communities and make your vote matter in each of them, you need many different tokens\u2026OR DO YOU? WHAT IF you could own **a governance token that was governing 10 or 100 projects at the time**?\n\nAs farming gives you governance token rewards, you will normally dump that token on the market for ETH. What if there was a platform that would just:\n\nA. reward you in **ETH** and\n\nB. only IF you chose to take your rewards in the governance token instead of **ETH** then the governance token would be bought from the market and distributed to you?\n\n...then...\n\nC. We would have no dumping of the governance token, only solid \u2018pumpamentals\u2019.\n\n**Dracula Protocol** does this. When you have different LP-tokens from several other farming projects Dracula gives you the option to stake them on its native platform. It then farms your tokens and automatically sells the \"victim\" governance tokens to the market for ETH, keeping just a tiny portion of the \u201cvictims\u201d governance token in Dracula\u2019s vault \u2014 *we will come back to the vault part in a moment*.\n\nNow, the **ETH** rewards then get automatically compounded with **ETH** staking on a trusted platform such as **AAVE**, so the rewards get another boost.\n\nWhen you decide to harvest your rewards, you either choose to receive all that **ETH**, or if you choose to receive it in Dracula governance token **DRC**, the code automatically buys **DRC** from the market and distributes **DRC** to you.\n\nBut why would you want to receive the governance token?\n\nThe vault man, the vault. The vault now holds governance tokens from other protocols. Let\u2019s say Dracula would have 2% of all circulating tokens of SUSHI in its vault. **If you then hold DRC, you are holding tokens with 2% voting power in SUSHI governance.**\n\nYes, you read that right.\n\n**Dracula will delegate the voting power from its partners to DRC holders.** While you stake your **DRC** on Dracula, **you will also be receiving a small portion of all ETH** rewards piled on the platform.\n\nTo add a cherry to the top, all actions on **Dracula Protocol** are crowdfunded from the total rewards. This will help all the users as all the fees get cut big time.\n\nThese elements solve the problem of only whales being able to act freely in an ecosystem, and the whales dumping. They also solve a problem with governance as today so many votes do not get used as you often need to pay a fee to vote, too.\n\nOne problem remains though: How to bring liquidity to create an incentive for someone to buy into a project with big money. Also, how to have liquidity to buffer the price when going downwards, too?\n\n# PART 2: DECENTRALIZE THE LIQUIDITY FOR A MILLION YEARS TO COME\n\nEnter **Toad Network**.\n\nIn **TOAD** you farm using your LP-tokens and you get rewarded with LP-tokens. The trick is that when you enter LP-token farm, you pay a 10% fee. And when you exit you pay another 10%.\n\nWait a minute, isn\u2019t that how some Ponzi would work? You\u2019ll see soon enough.\n\nThese LP-token fees will become future farming rewards. You can withdraw your farmed rewards without an additional fee.\n\nThen you can use those rewards by adding them to **TOAD-BNB** staking pool to gain rewards in **TOAD**. And again, you can stake **TOAD** to receive staking rewards for more **TOAD**.\n\nSo, the minute the whales come in for their treat of eating and sh\\*tting on the project, they\u2019ll give 10% to the existing community of LP farmers. And when they are done with their lunch and withdrawing LPs to dump on the market, f\\*ck yeah, they give ANOTHER 10% to the whole community. Don\u2019t you love where this is going?\n\nInstead of a Ponzi, we have a long-term hodler & farmer community with decentralized & perpetual liquidity. For a million years to come\u2026\n\nNow, as said, **TOAD** is building an ecosystem of **perpetual liquidity**. Bored of pancakeswap forks and their lack of vision, Toad will launch their own swap soon. As they will use their code on tokens listed on the exchange, there will be enough liquidity for good amount of trading with no possibilities for teams to do rug-pulls. **Toad Network** is building something that no other project is offering \u2014 at least I haven\u2019t dyorred any that do.\n\nThe huge liquidity will also serve as a reserve for a myriad of financial tools such as lending and savings.\n\nDeFi for the people\u2019s republic of crypto space. Or resistance. Or whatever you want to call it.\n\nThese two projects work on different blockchains, **Dracula on Ethereum** and **Toad Network on Binance Smartchain**, but both see their near future as **cross-chain**. Meaning the elements of both ecosystems will serve all of the crypto space.\n\nLet\u2019s cut it here. Now I ask you to talk to the devs and see if they\u2019re BASED on not.","268":"Dracula Protocol V2 launch is around the corner! We have recently completed an [audit of our V2 contracts](https:\/\/solidity.finance\/audits\/Dracula\/) with Solidity Finance, which resulted in no security issues and overall praise for our developers\u2019 abilities.\n\nWith this audit complete, the Dracula team now feels confident enough to move onto the testing phase of our contracts, which will begin with deploying the V2 contracts on the Ethereum Kovan testnet. We will be running a series of stress-tests, but are confident that the functionality of the DRC token will remain unchanged throughout this testing phase and are comfortable releasing details about the planned tokenomics for V2.\n\nDracula Protocol V2 will continue to use the DRC token that was used on V1, although the utility of DRC will be much different.\n\n**DRC Supply Cap:** The DRC token, which can be found on Etherscan at [https:\/\/etherscan.io\/token\/0xb78B3320493a4EFaa1028130C5Ba26f0B6085Ef8](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/token\/0xb78B3320493a4EFaa1028130C5Ba26f0B6085Ef8), will have a capped supply at the launch of our V2 contracts, which will be an estimated amount of 15,000,000 DRC. At the moment of deploying, all DRC minting will be disabled. From here on out, there will never be a new DRC token minted again. Although this can be changed through a governance vote, the Dracula team strongly recommends a hard-cap on the DRC supply.\n\n**Static Supply:** Although there has been discussion around deflationary tokenomics, we have decided to not follow that path. By not having a percent of our drain allocated to burns, we can use the additional yield to increase the earnings of stakers for our victim pools and our DRC pool.\n\n**Drain Allocation:** Once every day, our platform will sell underlying rewards for ETH, which is known as a \u2018Drain\u2019. This drain will be called by the Dracula team and is funded by a portion of the underlying yields from victims. Going forward, we have plans to integrate a system of nodes to automatically call the drain once certain parameters are met through a strategic partnership.\n\nEach drain will be distributed as follows:  \n**85% of each drain** goes to liquidity providers of victim pools, such as SushiSwap or Pickle. These funds are automatically invested into an interest-earning ETH strategy, which will accrue additional yield until each user chooses to harvest their individual earnings. Users can choose to harvest their yields on ETH, *or in DRC,* for any of the pools. If a user chooses to harvest their yields in DRC, then the ETH they have earned is used to buy DRC off the open market at the time of withdrawal.\n\n**Note:** If a user unstakes within 24 hours from depositing into victim pools, there is a 0.5% fee taken from their liquidity. This is to prevent manipulation of the drain mechanism.\n\n**3.75% of each drain** goes to stakers in the DRC staking pool. This will be the only DRC staking pool, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**3% of each drain** goes to liquidity providers of the DRC\/ETH pool on {REDACTED}, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**3% of each drain** goes to liquidity providers of the DRC\/ETH pool on Uniswap, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**3.75% of each drain** goes to the developer fund to help continue the ongoing development of Dracula Protocol, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**1.5% of each drain** goes to the gas fund to pay for future drains, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**Note:** After each drain, these rewards are linearly distributed to each user over the following 24 hours, which will ensure consistent yields rather than spiked earnings after each drain.\n\n**DRC Utility:** The DRC token can be currently staked to earn 3.75% of all ETH that comes from drains. This design ensures that APRs for DRC staking is directly dependent on TVL of Dracula Protocol and the APRs from underlying platforms.\n\nIf Dracula Protocol manages to capture significant TVL from underlying platforms with high APRs, the staked DRC token will have a direct cash-flow to this performance, paid in ETH. This token design is meant to focus on ROI for DRC token holders, where their initial investment to earn a share of protocol performance is quickly outpaced in terms of ETH earned.\n\nDRC also has voting rights to the future of Dracula Protocol. Going forward, we plan on adding new features to add to the utility of DRC, such as integrations with lending platforms, tokenized staking for composability, and more.\n\nWe believe that the DRC token can be used as an *index token for the performance of the underlying DeFi platforms*, as its returns are directly dependent on APRs for its victims, which are a result of healthy token appreciation from underlying platforms like SUSHI or PICKLE. This functionality creates a synergy between Dracula and its victims and opens the possibility for future collaboration with any of the underlying platforms.\n\nThe implications of the V2 DRC token design are massive and we are truly excited to have this idea come to fruition. Our next update will be at the launch of our V2 contracts on mainnet, where all of the described changes will be live in production. We will also be detailing our ecosystem partners after our V2 launch, which are fundamental to Dracula Protocol, DRC, and the future of DeFi.\n\n**Keep up with us on our socials for further updates, soon to come!**\n\nTwitter: [https:\/\/twitter.com\/DraculaProtocol](https:\/\/twitter.com\/DraculaProtocol)","269":"**Flame TL;DR:**   \n Flame is a utility token for the creator economy.

Extreme market push. Huge market cap in the making. Active market. Buy on Uniswap.\n\nIts main competitor, $ICE, had a $32 mil. market cap on 5 September. Two months later, on 5 November, $ICE hit an ATH of $695 mil. market cap.\n\nCurrently, on 17 November, $PILOT has a $56 mil. mcap. Can it grow to $1.3 bil mcap., in the same time span, in two months, on 17 January? I think it can. I will explain why.\n\n$PILOT and $ICE are automatic liquidity optimizers, but $PILOT has the advantage to be universal. This means LPs can provide liquidity for ANY Uniswap pair. $ICE has only a limited amount of about 20 set pools, while $PILOT can provide pools for an unlimited number of pairs. \n\nThe second biggest difference between $PILOT and $ICE is the Unipilot Index Fund. $PILOT takes a percentage of the fees earned by LPs and sends it to the Index Fund. The Index Fund will contain mainly blue chips. Users will be able to burn their $PILOT tokens, to have exposure to the Index Fund tokens. Why would people exchange their $PILOT for the Index Fund share of tokens? Because at some point, you might have $1000 in $PILOT tokens, but if you burn it, you could get $1500 worth of tokens from the Index Fund. So, you burn your $PILOT, claim your tokens from the Index Fund, and you can re-buy even more $PILOT. The Index Fund will work as a rising price floor for $PILOT. The Index Fund can pump $PILOT price, in these situations.\n\nIn addition, 78% of the supply will be burnt over 3 years, quarterly, by the team, including their own tokens! So, with all the burns done each time someone wants to get access to the Index Fund tokens, $PILOT has deflationary tokenomics.\n\nMainnet for $PILOT is set for 18th November. After mainnet, $PILOT has tons of updates planned: \n1. Cross chain \n2. Sushiswap Trident support \n3. xPILOT and $PILOT staking \n4. Flash fees & Index pools \n5. Interest free stable coin loans \n6. Locking liquidity solution on Uniswap v3 \n...and much more.\n\n$PILOT team is planning a so-called Vampire Attack on mainnet launch day, a lot of liquidity will be directed into protocol. So what is a Vampire Attack? The liquidity is basically sucked out of the first platform and moved into the second platform, hence the name. The first step of a Vampire Attack is to incentivise liquidity providers of another platform to stake their LP tokens, which represent supplied liquidity, to a new platform. It's what Sushiswap did with Uniswap.\n\nBecause $PILOT is the ONLY universal optimizer on the market, huge amounts of liquidity will come through the Pilot Protocol. The TVL and the Index Fund will grow accordingly, with tens or even hundreds of millions each month. The price of $PILOT will moon hard. Remember that it was fair launched, so there are no presalers or VCs to dump on you. The liquidity on Uniswap is huge (currently sitting at $20 mil.), so whales will be attracted to buy huge stacks of $PILOT.\n\nOne more thing, $PILOT has received an #Uniswap grant and passed with flying colors 3 independent audits. Hundreds of people were involved in testnet contests. I already saw the interface of their platform and the UI is simply amazing. I think you haven't seen anything yet. The best part of the price action for $PILOT will come after the mainnet. Farming will be launched in the same day with the mainnet launch.\n\nMost people wanted to see all those features working live before they buy $PILOT, so I assume after it will go live, they will FOMO buy it. Avoid the FOMO while you still can and buy a $PILOT bag now. $PILOT to $1200? Possibly. $PILOT to $600? Probably.\n\nYou can buy $PILOT on Uniswap.

(Some do say, NFTs are financial bubbles, do you agree?)\n\nHmm\ud83e\udd14,\n\nEven DeFi was called all sorts of names and was declared as a gamble and a scam, but taking a good look at this sector, we got over a billion dollars and more locked in DeFi, so it's not a bubble, can you remember when DeFi started? It was just like the frenzy caused by NFT. We all know there will be a glass ceiling that needs to be broken for these unicorns to soar higher, but do we have these to bring glory to the decentralised world?\ud83d\ude44\n\nAave, Uniswap, dydx, Sushi, Mango markets, even Mirror\/Synthetix comes to mind as key players in driving home the decentralized finance goals, but these haven't been able to bend the rules as to allow the illiquidity of NFTs come play in these league. Well, that's the twist, GovWorld through its jewel, GovLend brings to the block.\n\nWe can get our NFTs collateralised and suck out stablecoins from within this protocol, a very useful case for DeFi as we got huge amounts of money lying fallow in our wallets. I understand the cultural value NFTs bring to us as a society, but we can get more from them while still being a member of our communities like the BAYC or MAYC.\n\nFinally Govworld, is all about the community and is backed by DAOs (Protocol DAOs namely; DuckDAO and Ferrum Network) and got it's private sale on DDIM sold out under 5 minutes, soon FRM and FRMx holders will get an opportunity to participate in an exclusive strategic partner's pool for the GOV tokens (this is also opened to other partners). Meanwhile, it's still 3 days to the closure of its early adopters reward contest.\n\nWith Govworld on the block, DeFi summer just got heated. See y'all on the beach front.\n\n[GovWorld](https:\/\/www.govworld.io\/)\n\n[Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/govworld1)","276":"THE NEW BSC MOONSHOT TOKEN!\n\n\ud83c\udf71Earn $Sushi Passively By Holding Musubi!\ud83c\udf71\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 FAIRLAUNCH  15TH SEPTEMBER 6PM UTC \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udea8 \n\nWelcome folks!

Let me introduce you *Utrin.*\n\n# What is Utrin ?\n\n*Utrin* stands for ***U***niversal ***Tr***ade ***In***terface. One user interface for many swap protocols. A native application built to trade conventionally on decentralized exchange protocols.\n\n\u2705**MULTICHAIN**:\n\nStarting with Uniswap on the Ethereum chain and adding on to the list as they go down their roadmap. Fully working on SushiSwap too, they are working now to implement PancakeSwap.\n\n\u2705**INSIGHT**:\n\nUtrin offers tools for technical analysis on all trading pairs. This allows the user to make analytical decisions before doing a trade; all in one simple interface.\n\n\u2705**ASSET MONITORING**:\n\nSay goodbye to manually adding ERC-20 tokens to your portfolio. *Utrin* knows what tokens you hold based on your trading activity and makes sure to track the corresponding data for the ones relevant to you (e.g. Logo, Market Cap, Price, Ticker etc.).\n\nLook at [the official promo video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-EL2trh2uSU).\n\n# More about Utrin:\n\n\u2705**SECURE**:\n\n*Utrin* works like any locally installed Ethereum wallet. You manage your own private key. All information and files Utrin needs are stored locally on your PC or device.\n\n\ud83d\udd25**LIMIT ORDERS (yes, yes!)**:\n\nPlace swap orders that are automatically executed when certain conditions (e.g. price or liquidity) are reached! Export executed swaps as a .CSV file for your own financial administration. Imagine placing limit orders on every DEX : Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap...\n\n\u2705**NO SUBSCRIPTIONS**:\n\nTo use *Utrin*, you simply pay $20 USD in tokens every 30 days. This can easily be done through the client. No yearly subscription needed!\n\nLoot at [the introduction to Utrin in this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eHFLFdtQxcg).\n\n# Tokenomics:\n\nYou can see the [circulating supply refreshed here](http:\/\/128.199.39.138\/circulating\/). **The current MC is around $800k \ud83d\ude32**.\n\nEach Utrin user pays $20 USD every 30 days to use the software. This payment is made in Utrin Tokens, by means of a contract call to the Utrin smart contract. This can be done easily by using the Utrin application\/client.\n\n**40% of the tokens used for payment are burned immediately**. The remaining **60% goes to the dividend pool**, part of which is paid out to those who\u00a0hold the token.\n\nOn the first day of each month the 90% of the tokens in the dividend pool are sent to the Utrin Team \/ Development fund. The remaining 10% will be airdropped to all addresses (except for the team and burn addresses) who hold more than 200 Utrin tokens.\n\n[Full tokenomics detailed here](https:\/\/utrin.io\/token-economics\/).\n\n# Links to DYOR:\n\n[Website](https:\/\/utrin.io\/) | [Dextools](https:\/\/www.dextools.io\/app\/uniswap\/pair-explorer\/0xe6c4121ecedb69778558d29765194df261e8e886) | [Etherscan](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/token\/0x99f2b69ee2468c834a634ff50d930ae64e3e500f) | [Communities](https:\/\/utrin.io\/communities\/) (Telegram channel for news, community, technical chat, trading chat...)| [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Utrin_io) | [Roadmap](https:\/\/utrin.io\/roadmap\/) | [Unicrypt](https:\/\/unicrypt.network\/amm\/uni\/pair\/0xe6c4121eCEdB69778558D29765194Df261E8E886)\n\nDYOR as usual guys, but for me, it's a \ud83d\udc8e !

Front-running bots are rampant due to slow transaction times making your buy\/sell at a higher\/lower price.\n\nI can't say for other DEX(decentralized exchanges) but if I compare this to Quickswap...\n\n* Near-instant transactions takes less than 5 seconds.\n* Near-zero gas fee. Way less than a cent.\n* Bonus : Recently integrated Transak which enables users of Quickswap to buy crypto with credit card going through a CEX. (First DEX to make it that accessible)\n\nI'd hate myself looking like a blind fool ignoring the problems and difficulties Quickswap needs to overcome though.\n\n* Low liquidity. BUT 11days ago liquidity was at 15 mil USD. NOW it's at 100 mil USD. (explosive growth)\n* Changing from ETH mainnet wallet -> MATIC mainnet wallet can be quite confusing for newcomers.

Usually this would raise a red flag for me, but its uncommon that a project first takes care of product and code before doing any kind of marketing, or even admitting that they exist in the first place, so this doesn't bother me.\n\n*\"DeFiat (DFT) is a fully-governed, deflationary ERC-20 token with a multi-tiered loyalty reward system. Every time DFT is transacted, an amount from the transaction is taken for fees and another amount is permanately burned; naturally reducing supply over time. Holders of DFT are granted proportional voting rights in network decisions, such as setting the burn and fee rates. DeFiat's Unified-Staking (UniStake) platform allows users to stake any ERC-20 token in the governance-chosen liquidity pools, making your money work for you. Users also gain loyalty points, in the form of DFTP, as they interact with the DeFiat ecosystem, resulting in lower fee and burn rates on DFT transactions.\"*\n\nPulled out a few things I like from their whitepaper as well as from their dev's in TG:\n\n> - Rewards for participation via governance, including discounts for future burn\/tx fees.\n> \n> - Removal of liquidity will incur standard fees.\n> \n> - Governance solution which creates redundancy and provides safety measures whilst simultaneously leading community efforts.\n> \n> - Elastic token that can adapt to a continuously evolving market featuring new technical landscapes.\n> \n> - DeFiat Services also integrates the Unified-Staking Protocol (UniStake), thus allowing members of the DFT Ecosystem to stake any ERC-20 token and be rewarded in the form of DFT.\n> \n> - As DeFiat can expand and acquire more resources, other disruptive services will be implemented to the DeFi platform. \/\/\/\/\/\/ *THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING STAKING NOW, IMMINENT RELEASE.

An additional 10% of the tokens will be locked and allocated towards marketing.\n> \n> - Community-driven governance (DeFiat community retains the ability to decide when these marketing tokens become unlocked, and subsequently, how they are spent).\n> \n> - No REBASE. It's purely deflationary by design.\n\nTo be fair, when most of these DeFi shitcoins launch they don't have:\n\n- A fully fledged ecosystem with 3 contracts\n\n- A baked whitepaper\n\n- An actual site with working dashboard\n\n- Locked liquidity\n\nTheir road-map seems to be aggressive with 100% functionality being available by EOY. Highly recommend talking to their dev \"stupid.\" He knows his shit and has leaked that a ton of features are in the works.\n\nLong story short I'll be keeping an eye on this one as it's still massively under the radar.

I plan to hold until at least $20-30 (which should come soon), and heres why.\n\nThe project has extreme potential. I would honestly call it revolutionary for lack of a less dramatic word. Basically, those who have BTC have nothing to do with it in terms of compounding their capital, outside of hodling of course. Although hodling BTC has been insanely profitable, as we all know, Strudel will allow Bitcoin to become more versatile by integrating its vBTC coin (pegged to Bitcoin) with the ERC20 interface and smart contract interoperability. When you burn BTC, vBTC is minted.\n\nWhat if you want your Bitcoin back? Simply exchange your new vBTC for another coin, then back to BTC.\n\nThe Strudel coin is the governance token for vBTC, and acts as the intermediary that wraps BTC and creates the oft-mentioned trustless bridge. When such a bridge is trusted, several people own the digital signatures that form the essence of wBTC. Technically, it is possible for these people to collaborate and rugpull, as they are the ones that own the signatures to the bitcoin. With Strudel, this bridge is trustless, meaning that the aforementioned digital signatures are not in the hands of others.\n\nNow onto the other aspects of this coin.\n\nIt was created by Keno, who went on to be a core dev at Sushi--he is now back on the Strudel team as an advisor.\n\nHolders and volume have increased at a great rate over the past few days.\n\nAlthough not officially announced, a partnership is Badgership is heavily rumored by the devs themselves and essentially confirmed.\n\nVery low mCap, especially compared to Ren, the closest thing to a competitor.\n\nV2 is coming out this week.\n\nI was promoting ASKO on here in comments back at single digit cents, and now I've compiled this post regarding the next coin that I personally think is set to moon (even further) based on the above points.\n\nTake a look and lmk what you think.","294":"**It all began in a post apocalyptic, COVID infected world.

It is the one and only decentralized exchange that works on Matic network (or Polygon, as it is called nowadays), and has ***liquidity of $100M*** and the ***volume has varied between $10M-$40M*** during the last two weeks.\n\nIt's ***market cap equals to only $23.8M*** at the time of this post, and that's ridiculously low. To have some comparison, JulSwap's token has market cap of over 100M, and it has about the same volumes with less liquidity than Quickswap. Also, it operates on a centralized chain (BSC), so there is that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How large are the gas fees?**\n\nWell, frankly, there are basically no gas fees. Matic is a layer 2 solution for Ethereum, and it has very very little gas fees, and pretty much instant transfers. Matic is a continuously growing network with limitless possibilities for sectors like decentralized gaming, NFTs, and DeFi. So if you are used to cursing the high fees on Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc. Quickswap is THE solution for you. Also, when compared to PancakeSwap, Quick is still quicker and cheaper, and best of all; decentralized.\n\nHere's a how-to-guide for adding Matic Mainnet to your Metamask and using the bridge between Ethereum and Matic, and also a link to the actual bridge:\n\n[https:\/\/blog.matic.network\/deposits-and-withdrawals-on-pos-bridge\/](https:\/\/blog.matic.network\/deposits-and-withdrawals-on-pos-bridge\/)\n\n[https:\/\/wallet.matic.network\/bridge](https:\/\/wallet.matic.network\/bridge)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How does the future look for Quickswap?**\n\nThere's a couple things that will automatically increase the usage, and that way increase the value of Quick:\n\n1. Aavegotchi. *The game* on blockchain. Already got these awesome NFTs, a marketplace for the NFTs, awesome community, and a hefty treasury fund. The Metaverse is gonna be released soon (this is another moonshot)\n2. Sushiswap. Wait... what?? Yes, you heard me correctly. Sushiswap has deployed contracts on all these layer 2s, one of them being Matic. But it's not a bad thing at all. It's gonna bring more people to Matic, and probably more token implementations too. It also enables 1inch operating there and implementing Quickswap too. Lastly, Sushi needs to divide their rewards between all these solutions, creating another advantage to Quickswap.\n3. Matic developing the instant bridge. This is just plain huge for Quickswap. This makes the arbitrage possible between Quickswap and Uniswap, creating instant huge volumes for Quick. New tokens are constantly being integrated to Matic and Quick too, creating even more possibilities for this to happen.\n4. High gas fees on Ethereum. No need for an explanation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What are the tokenomics then?**\n\nGood question. Let's see:\n\n* Circulating\/Total supply: 160K\/1M\n   * The rest are being liquidity mined, so people are strongly encouraged to provide liquidity\n   * The team is currently reviewing the pairs for the next LP mining program (changes once a week), so that the pools with lots of dumping providers are gonna have lesser rewards.\n* Market cap: 23.8M\n* Price: 148$\n   * This is basically a fucking fire sale\n* Token use case: governance\n   * There has only been one vote (see next bulletpoint) so far, but as the project gets further, the token's gonna act as a governance token, and all the big decisions are going to be done collectively.\n      * It is crucial for decently new projects to not vote on everything, so that it is actually possible to develop the system\n* Staking possibilities: Very soon\n   * There was a vote on this, and with an extremely high percentage it was decided that instead of the old whole trading fee 0.3% going to the liquidity providers, there's going to be a new division\n      * 0.25% to the liquidity providers, 0.04% to the stakers, and 0.01% to the devs.\n      * This is very bullish as there's gonna be staking, but also because the half of the 0.05% is gonna be used to buy back QUICK, as it is being shared as staking reward and dev salary.\n* Edit: Forgot to add that it's not listed on any CEX yet other than Bilaxy. \n   * Once it does, it's going to help with the price\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Okay, then the TL;DR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Liquidity 100M, volume 10M-40M, way undervalued\n* Basically instant and free swaps, still decentralized\n* Very bullish near future\n* Solid tokenomics with low (under 24M) market cap\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And lastly, we have some links for you guys:**\n\nQuickswap: [https:\/\/quickswap.exchange\/#\/swap](https:\/\/quickswap.exchange\/#\/swap)\n\nTelegram: [https:\/\/t.me\/QuickSwapDEX](https:\/\/t.me\/QuickSwapDEX)\n\nCoingecko: [https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/quick](https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/quick)\n\n(Guides for moving on to Matic network are above)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: Not financial advice but imho easy 20x.
