Honored I found it and got in so early! Not to late for anyone else at all!","1861":"All honesty, this is the one.  Slow steady growth not just some shill shitcoin that everyone is trying to pump.  The tokenomics are good, the dev is fully doxxed, and the community is good and growing.  Basically new ATHs daily but without massive spikes of volatility that cause paper hands.\n\nThings people need to know:7% tax, broken down as mentioned above.  The lotto has been a fun thing... some people have bought $200 worth and won $2400, its crazy.  The odds of winning are pretty high (basically if you buy 400M tokens you have a 0.7% chance of winning so at 100 purchases (about $1500-2000 worth of tokens) you accumulate tokens PLUS have a 50% chance of winning the lotto.  That jumps to 75% odds of winning at 200 purchases.  So if you are planning on accumulating anyway just do a bunch of smaller buys and hopefully you'll get a lotto bonus. \n\nThe buyback (1% of the tax) is now at ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND.  That is guaranteed to raise the price when it gets randomly deployed.  Those tokens when bought get burned.  That means over 2 Trillion tokens will be burned on this buyback, currently almost 20% of TOTAL SUPPLY has already been burned, 187 trillion.  The supply is going to decrease faster and faster as volume continues to increase.\n\nThe whales are being smart.  So far of the top 30 whales only 1 has liquidated.  2-3 are selling only tiny portions to take some profits but without killing the price.  The top whale sold 2% the other day, holding onto the vast majority and not trying to hurt the project. There is a 21% whale tax if someone tries to sell more than 250B tokens in one day.\n\nThe dev had other projects previously which he learned from, in particular changes made to be able to get listed on multiple exchanges.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a sell tax of 14-15%, creating a lot of HODLers and that tax just contributes more to the 2,4,5, and 6 of the buy tax distribution with 1% going to 1,3,7.\n\nOverall I personally do NOT get into many cryptomoonshots but this one I have found worth the risk.  If anyone cares, another one I like is PETS (micropets) but that one hasnt gained the same traction yet.","1862":"When Bifrost comes online this project is going to another level.
