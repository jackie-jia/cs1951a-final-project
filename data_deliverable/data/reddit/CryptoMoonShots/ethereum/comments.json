Developers have 3% of total tokens, the rest LP'ed. \n\nIt's not as if you can't do both. Every trader is not going to part with his entire portfolio as a donation.

Aren\u2019t the taxes temporarily  increased while the MC is increasing","351":"Now down 37%","352":"As I was sitting in my living room, musing over the charts, I was trying to imagine what the future might hold for the project. Is it sustainable?  Should I view this as a short term pump? A meme coin with a 6 month shelf life? Or is it a project that I actually believe in?\n\nI am always a skeptic, but this project is winning me over.  Firstly, and most importantly, the team for this token is incredible. They have fulfilled their promises, handled themselves with class, been focused and engaged.   \n\nThe next most important thing is the tokenomics.  The concept behind the project is that the tokenomics reward the holders without adding sell pressure (like tokens that reward holders in busd or bnb).  It is also designed to facilitate onboarding new holders. The tax is heavily weighted toward sells. Currently the taxes are 1% on buys and 25% on sells. The buy tax and 15% of the sell tax is currently going to marketing. They are getting the word out!  Marketing wallet is HUGE and the marketing team is incredible (led by Travladd). 4% is a buy back that goes to the burn wallet and 6% goes to staking rewards.  It\u2019s important to remember that these numbers can be changed as needed. The total tax to get in and get out is 26%, which is pretty comparable to most projects that have buy\/sell taxes. \n\nThe main feature of the token is its staking.  Holders can stake their tokens for either 7 days (300% apy) or 30 days (500% apy). Rewards are paid in GREEN and can be compounded into your principle daily. These gains are insane. Just like the buy and sell tax, these numbers can be adjusted when needed.  Sellers pay for the staking rewards. \n\nWhen considering the longevity of a crypto project, the first question is \u201cwhy would anyone want to buy this project besides hype?\u201d\n\nThis is my vision for what green chart might be in the future. Green chart is a project and community of people who\u2019s sole goal is to increase your wealth and GREEN token is a ticket for a seat at the table. You get in.  You stake your tokens. You cash out whenever you\u2019ve reached your financial goals and your sell tax goes back to community.  When you sell, you are giving up your seat at the table and the next person in line takes it.  The token is deflationary so these \u201cseats\u201d will become increasingly scarce and more valuable. \n\nA sell should be celebrated. It means someone has reached their goals and paid their tribute to the holders. \n\nThis is why GREEN will be valuable. It is a ticket to financial freedom.  \n\nSmall cap plays are always risky, but this one is very optimistic.","353":"Be sure to do your own diligence.

They gonna charge me 139.00","624":"Tried to buy but the gas fee hit me in the nuts.

At this point, any L2 project is a bullish thing.","633":"The coin will moon simply because of first-mover advantage. Reminds me AVAX recently.

A chart visualises performance of the coin and makes it easy to read. Not everyone understands Marketcap","640":"The website needs some work but we'll get there eventually. People still know the value since it's been pumping since launch.","641":"Yeah, why would you do that? If there's no chart, the price could dump and you would have no idea. Charts are super important. The fact that Arbimoon has one is really promising.","642":"Heard that it was the first arbitrum altcoin to obtain its own graph. That per se speaks a lot.","643":"Graphs just makes everything easier","644":"Sadly it's a hit or miss world for networks that are relatively new, just like Arbitrum.","645":"exactly. its always nice to have a second chance","646":"No way, arbitrum solved the problem with fees, it is much lower","647":"Only the rich can take advantage of this coin. Maybe the gas fee is a good support to why L2 projects like this is a bullish thing.","648":"I wanna say mass adoption but I'm partially afraid that whales might take control if mass adoption happens. \\*fingers crossed.","649":"The team is fast and effective. Not much more you can ask from a project","650":"Wow very bullish, I knew this one was gonna be big, so far is the best project in arbitrum","651":"Most investors don't understand it at all. A chart is necessary for something to become popular with average people who aren't tech savvy.","652":"it speaks to how fast and effective the team is. Im very impressed","653":"When I tried to deposit at the bridge. It said gas fees were 140 bucks for 50 dollars worth of eth to be deposited","654":"Hang on... I bought eth not the new eth 2 or whatever it's called.

Aren\u2019t the taxes temporarily  increased while the MC is increasing","1407":"Now down 37%","1408":"As I was sitting in my living room, musing over the charts, I was trying to imagine what the future might hold for the project. Is it sustainable?  Should I view this as a short term pump? A meme coin with a 6 month shelf life? Or is it a project that I actually believe in?\n\nI am always a skeptic, but this project is winning me over.  Firstly, and most importantly, the team for this token is incredible. They have fulfilled their promises, handled themselves with class, been focused and engaged.   \n\nThe next most important thing is the tokenomics.  The concept behind the project is that the tokenomics reward the holders without adding sell pressure (like tokens that reward holders in busd or bnb).  It is also designed to facilitate onboarding new holders. The tax is heavily weighted toward sells. Currently the taxes are 1% on buys and 25% on sells. The buy tax and 15% of the sell tax is currently going to marketing. They are getting the word out!  Marketing wallet is HUGE and the marketing team is incredible (led by Travladd). 4% is a buy back that goes to the burn wallet and 6% goes to staking rewards.  It\u2019s important to remember that these numbers can be changed as needed. The total tax to get in and get out is 26%, which is pretty comparable to most projects that have buy\/sell taxes. \n\nThe main feature of the token is its staking.  Holders can stake their tokens for either 7 days (300% apy) or 30 days (500% apy). Rewards are paid in GREEN and can be compounded into your principle daily. These gains are insane. Just like the buy and sell tax, these numbers can be adjusted when needed.  Sellers pay for the staking rewards. \n\nWhen considering the longevity of a crypto project, the first question is \u201cwhy would anyone want to buy this project besides hype?\u201d\n\nThis is my vision for what green chart might be in the future. Green chart is a project and community of people who\u2019s sole goal is to increase your wealth and GREEN token is a ticket for a seat at the table. You get in.  You stake your tokens. You cash out whenever you\u2019ve reached your financial goals and your sell tax goes back to community.  When you sell, you are giving up your seat at the table and the next person in line takes it.  The token is deflationary so these \u201cseats\u201d will become increasingly scarce and more valuable. \n\nA sell should be celebrated. It means someone has reached their goals and paid their tribute to the holders. \n\nThis is why GREEN will be valuable. It is a ticket to financial freedom.  \n\nSmall cap plays are always risky, but this one is very optimistic.","1409":"Be sure to do your own diligence.

I will give it a try.","2297":"I'm Jimmy, a gay guy in my mid-twenties.  I'm not out, and stay discrete,\nsince society is still pretty judgmental, even with all the progress made\nin recent years.  I date women and do enjoy being with them, but when we\nmake love I am usually thinking of sucking a cock.\n\nI especially like sucking black cock, and would do it exclusively if there\nwere more available to me.  I have considered moving to a big city like\nDetroit, New York or Atlanta, where there were many more black men, but at\nthis point I'm tied down by my job to a medium sized Midwestern city.  I\nlive in a rural area outside the city, which makes it even more difficult\nto meet black guys.  One perk of rural life is an abundance of wooded\nareas, and I love to give blowjobs in the woods!\n\nOne Saturday I decided to take a walk in the nearby woods.  There were a\nnumber of trails that served hikers mainly, but a few horse riders used\nthem as well, so you had to pay attention to where you stepped.\n\nThen I saw something I had never seen before: a naked black man leading a\nhorse.  He was about my size and age, but his cock was huge!\n\nThe common myth is that all black cocks are huge, but in fact they come in\nall sizes.  Just the same, the biggest cocks I've ever seen have all been\nblack.\n\nHis horse was, quite literally, \"hung like a horse\".  His cock had to be at\nleast 15 inches long, and about two inches in diameter.  What was unusual\nhowever was that his cock didn't end in a flare, which can sometimes spread\nto four or five inches across.  Instead there was a slight ridge, not\nunlike some human cocks.  If I ever encountered such a cock on a man my\nknees would go weak!\n\nI was stunned to see the naked black man, but decided to take advantage of\nthis opportunity.  \"Hello,\" I said, \"I'm Jimmy \u2013 and you are very well\nendowed.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, \"I'm Jake \u2013 come check me out if you like.\"\n\nHe was testing if I was a faggot or not, and since we were alone, and I\nreally wanted his cock, there was no reason to hold back.  I approached him\nand tentatively reached for his cock, pausing just before reaching it.\n\n\"It's okay,\" Jake said.\n\nI took his cock in my hand and felt him grow in response.  Jake began to\nbreathe harder and I asked, \"may I suck you?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said, \"after you blow my horse.\"\n\n\"What?\" I replied, \"I'm a faggot but I don't do animals!\"\n\n\"Too bad,\" he said, \"How do you know if you'll like it if you don't try?\"\n\nI stroked his cock, hoping that his arousal would change his mind.  Soon he\nwas fully erect and said, \"You can get closer if you like \u2013 even kiss or\nlick, it, but no sucking.\"\n\nI dropped to my knees and kissed the tip of his cock head, licking a salty\ndrop of pre-cum.  He moaned with delight and said, \"I'll bet you suck\nreally well \u2013 too bad you won't blow my horse.  If that cock were on me\nI'll bet you would suck it, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"I sure would,\" I agreed.\n\n\"Why don't you go examine his cock before deciding for sure?\" he said.\n\nI decided to give it a try, and got up and walked back to the horse.  I\nbent over and took his cock in my hand and he responded by snorting and\nhardening a bit.\n\n\"Isn't this dangerous?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not very,\" said Jake, \"He is used to white faggots, and I stand by his\nhead to calm him.\"\n\nFor a moment I considered blowing the horse \u2013 what could it hurt?  I\ndecided to reason with Jake.\n\n\"Come on, you want me to suck you, so why not just let me do it?\" I\npleaded.\n\n\"I'm sure that you will like blowing my horse once you try it,\" Jake\nexplained, \"When will you ever have another chance?\"\n\nJake was right \u2013 I had never had such an opportunity before and may\nnever again.  I was getting interested in this strange prospect.  I looked\nclosely at the horse cock as I stroked it.  The absence of a flare made the\nhead small enough to fit in my mouth \u2013 without any room to spare, but at\nleast I could get it in.  It would be like blowing a well-hung guy.\n\n\"Okay, I'll try,\" I said, \"but I can't promise to take him all the way.\"\n\n\"Jimmy,\" admonished Jake, \"You know that you just don't start a blowjob and\nnot finish it!\"\n\n\"I'm sure you'll like it,\" continued Jake, \"And then you can suck me.\"\n\nI don't know what I was thinking, but it all seemed to make sense to me,\nand I told Jake I would blow his horse.\n\n\"You should probably take your clothes off,\" advised Jake, \"so you don't\nget his cum on your clothes.\"\n\nThat sounded like a good idea so I undressed, hanging my clothes over a\nnearby tree branch.  The breeze felt good against my nakedness and soon I\nwas kneeling near the horse cock.  I took the cock in my hand and brought\nit to my open mouth.  It smelled of horse piss and didn't taste much\nbetter, but it was the biggest cock I had ever held.  The head filled my\nmouth and I sucked and ran my tongue over it as I stroked the cock.  While\nit was a truly unique experience, in some ways it was similar to sucking a\nwell endowed man \u2013 mouth full, and stroking to climax.\n\nJake urged me on, telling me I was doing well, and soon I felt his cock\nbegin to pulse and pump his load into my mouth.  It was truly like drinking\nfrom a fire hose and soon his hot cum spilled out my mouth and down my\nchest.  I tried not to swallow any of the vile stuff, but probably did\nswallow a little.  I hoped there would be no ill effect.\n\nWhen he stopped pumping, I let go of his cock and looked at my cum-covered\nbody.  I was glad I was naked, because I sure couldn't go home with all\nthis cum on my clothing!\n\n\"Really well done!\" declared Jake, \"You must be a pretty good cocksucker \u2013\nnow come suck me.\"\n\nI stood up, cum running down onto my legs.  Jake told me I could clean up\nlater, but his cock needed my mouth now, so I walked to him and knelt\nbefore him.\n\nI sucked his cock and loved it \u2013 perhaps it was worth blowing his horse.\nHe told me that I was a really good cocksucker as I ministered to his need.\nSoon he filled my mouth with his load, and this time I swallowed every\ndrop.\n\nI got up and Jake mentioned that there was a stream a few hundred yards\ndown the path where I could clean up.  He picked up my clothes and walked\nwith me to the stream and watched as I washed the sticky horse cum off my\nbody.  It would have been easier with soap and a washcloth, but I had to\nuse only my hands.  Once clean, I dressed and Jake handed me a card.\n\n\"Send me an email tonight,\" he said, \"and check out my website.\"\n\nI nodded and asked, \"Why are you out here like this?\"\n\n\"To find white faggots!\" Jake said.\n\n\"Like me?\" I said.\n\n\"Exactly!\" replied Jake, and we parted ways.\n\nThat night I sent Jake an email, telling him that I enjoyed sucking him, as\nwell as his horse.  I sure would never want anyone to know I did it, but I\nhad fond memories of it \u2013 even the flood of cum that covered me!\n\nI went to the website and saw an entry labeled \"Jimmy\" along with today's\ndate.\n\nI clicked on the link and saw pictures of me handling the horse and blowing\nhim, along with pictures of me blowing Jake.  He even had pics of me\ncovered by cum and cleaning up at the stream.  I had no idea he was taking\npictures, and would never have agreed to it.  I felt that I was now\npublicly outed as a pervert.\n\nI didn't mind being a pervert \u2013 I just didn't want everyone to know.\n\nI sent another email to Jake, telling him that I was shocked that he had\ntaken pictures and posted them.\n\nAbout an hour later I received a reply, saying that he understood my\nconcern but I had nothing to worry about as long as I continued to\nparticipate with him and his horse.  He gave me his address and told me to\ncome to his place next Saturday morning.\n\nThat night I jacked off remembering the events of the day, and found the\nmemory of blowing the horse to be especially exciting.  As I drifted off to\nsleep I realized that I now craved horse cock!","2298":"Be sure to do your own diligence. Assume that every project posted is a scam\/rug\/honeypot until proven otherwise.

Is it sustainable?  Should I view this as a short term pump? A meme coin with a 6 month shelf life? Or is it a project that I actually believe in?\n\nI am always a skeptic, but this project is winning me over.  Firstly, and most importantly, the team for this token is incredible. They have fulfilled their promises, handled themselves with class, been focused and engaged.   \n\nThe next most important thing is the tokenomics.  The concept behind the project is that the tokenomics reward the holders without adding sell pressure (like tokens that reward holders in busd or bnb).  It is also designed to facilitate onboarding new holders. The tax is heavily weighted toward sells. Currently the taxes are 1% on buys and 25% on sells. The buy tax and 15% of the sell tax is currently going to marketing. They are getting the word out!  Marketing wallet is HUGE and the marketing team is incredible (led by Travladd). 4% is a buy back that goes to the burn wallet and 6% goes to staking rewards.  It\u2019s important to remember that these numbers can be changed as needed. The total tax to get in and get out is 26%, which is pretty comparable to most projects that have buy\/sell taxes. \n\nThe main feature of the token is its staking.  Holders can stake their tokens for either 7 days (300% apy) or 30 days (500% apy). Rewards are paid in GREEN and can be compounded into your principle daily. These gains are insane. Just like the buy and sell tax, these numbers can be adjusted when needed.  Sellers pay for the staking rewards. \n\nWhen considering the longevity of a crypto project, the first question is \u201cwhy would anyone want to buy this project besides hype?\u201d\n\nThis is my vision for what green chart might be in the future. Green chart is a project and community of people who\u2019s sole goal is to increase your wealth and GREEN token is a ticket for a seat at the table. You get in.  You stake your tokens. You cash out whenever you\u2019ve reached your financial goals and your sell tax goes back to community.  When you sell, you are giving up your seat at the table and the next person in line takes it.  The token is deflationary so these \u201cseats\u201d will become increasingly scarce and more valuable. \n\nA sell should be celebrated. It means someone has reached their goals and paid their tribute to the holders. \n\nThis is why GREEN will be valuable. It is a ticket to financial freedom.  \n\nSmall cap plays are always risky, but this one is very optimistic.","2368":"\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80","2369":"Without a doubt!","2370":"\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","2371":"It's surreal how much we've grown, yet still so much to come!

Going to go buy some more!","2957":"Best opportunity to load up on Everrise. \nThe run to the top is just starting.\nJoin the TG. Awesome community! \nThe everown Dapp (contract renowncement and community vote to unlock contract for changes)\nwill generate income .\n50% of Dapp revenue to the BuyBack (kraken) and 25% divided amongst community as reflections.\n\nThis is unprecedented. Our Dev Titan is using business profit to pump back into the token price. After token buyback, they get Torched.\nHYPERDEFLATIONARY=HYPER PROFIT","2958":"The end of rugs is near!","2959":"The day we've all been waiting for! Proud to be an early investor in this project and so proud of the team!!","2960":"Been in since launch and can't fault the team or the community! This project will change everything. Please DYOR but the EverRise family is one in a million, you won't regret joining the project and being a part of history!","2961":"This is the future!","2962":"Amazing project, with aims to clean up the BSC space.  They will do it with the team they have.... No doubts in my mind at all!!","2963":"[deleted]","2964":"[deleted]","2965":"EverRise has singlehandedly redefined my standards for BSC project review, due to the manner in which their company\/community is run, and, the security tools now available to the space. I won\u2019t accept anything less going forward from any project.","2966":"The BSC changes tomorrow forEver! \ud83d\udd25","2967":"LFG ! \ud83d\udd25","2968":"EverRise is going to go down in history for bringing security to not only the BSC (to start) but to the ETH chain (and beyond) as well.  I highly recommend studying our [white paper](https:\/\/www.everrisecoin.com), examining our [core team](https:\/\/www.everrisecoin.com\/team\/) (look into the their qualifications), and keeping an eye out for how [our utility](https:\/\/www.everrisecoin.com\/#EcosystemDapps) *aims to solve a LOT of the issues in DeFi today*.  Tomorrow starts this process with the release of **EverOwn**: Where **Devs can renounce ownership of their smart contract and actually be able to GET IT BACK**, with a community vote.  Titan, the EverRise CEO, Founder, and Master Coder, Who was the first to implement the Buyback system into crypto - AKA \"**The Kraken**\", is currently working on his hand written Ethereum bridge so **EverOwn** can help keep people from getting rugged\/scammed on that chain as well.  **EverSale** is coming. **EverWallet** (not your typical wallet, actual true security that works with your existing wallet to add an extra layer of security, and this list of EverRise utility is growing.  EverRise launched on the 15th of June and our first dApp (**EverOwn**) is again being released tomorrow 9.8.21.  We're not like other tokens that announce utility and it never comes to fruition.  I could go on and on and on but please take a look at [www.everrisecoin.com](https:\/\/www.everrisecoin.com) and hit us up in our TG group.  Our community is like no other and **you'd be hard pressed** to find more intelligent, respectful, insightful, and funny people in one place anywhere (in crypto, at least).   Lastly.. EverRise is a longer-hold-type project with the ability to 1000x over time (my opinion) so if you jump in and ask \"Wen Moon\", you won't be ridiculed at all. You'll be welcomed and any of your questions will be answered.  Thank you for reading this and good luck either way!!","2969":"EverOwn will make it hard to scam or rugpull !","2970":"Everyone should know us by now. Tomorrow will be game changing.

But Everrise has truly impressed me. Titan set a goal and nailed it all under 3 months time since launch. With more groundbreaking security Dapps on the way Everrise is an easy long hold that will moon hard in time.","2976":"Really enjoying this project, so many components that make it a sound investment, and now products are starting to release on top of it all.","2977":"Most stable token in Crypto.\nand we can chose to buyback anytime.","2978":"LFG!!","2979":"[deleted]","2980":"No more rugs and scams!","2981":"[deleted]","2982":"EverOwn will change the game.

This is gonna a monster, it includes a KRAKEN to preserve your wealth and it has a burning deflationary mechanism. This is an easy 1000x when you include all these features!","2988":"When you know that the BSC needs a shake up...EverRise will be there to help do just that.","2989":"The Day Is Here!!","2990":"The commitment to make the crypto space more trustworthy by the EverRise team is incredible.","2991":"[removed]","2992":"Good DeFi project right here.

True professionals","2995":"[deleted]","2996":"This is the way","2997":"Exactly. From this point forward I see no point in investing in anything unless liquidity is locked in the everown contract. Things have gotten out of control and RISE is gonna fix that.","2998":"Yup. Every community should demand everown\nThe BSC will forever be remembered by Everown and not the pathetic place it was before Titan came along","2999":"Best in the BSC","3000":"As is a new standard!","3001":"Feels good to be proud of a bag for a change.

There's a huge, active, and hyped Telegram community that's managed astoundingly well by the dev team. And don't even get me started on the team itself. They've got a whole sticker pack (animated, too!), insane marketing, a gooorgeous website, and a very informative Medium page!\n\n**Safu.** \n\nThis might be the most easy I've felt with a project in my time on BSC. They've got their own dex, liquidity cannot be added, got liquidity in NOVA and BUSD, and much more! You can even check out their Medium page for a lot of the honest and transparent fixes, changes, and security updates and audits they've held to reassure their investors.\n\n**Selling out.**\n\nNeed I say more?\n\nIf you don't hop in on this project as soon as possible, then you're gonna be missing out.\n\nBig time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTG: babyboiyee","5618":"Personally finding a stable and long term project is hard.
