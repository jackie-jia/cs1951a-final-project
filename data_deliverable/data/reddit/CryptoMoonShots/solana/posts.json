Each nft has different stats (hp, defense, attack, energy, dodge, and critical hit) which are fueled by their attributes.\n\nThe objective is to fight against other players in a \"Battle royal\" mode to win the fights.\n\nThe  clashes are in 1v1 (for the moment) turn-based and the winner gets a  reward in SOL from a wallet which is fed with 80% of the royalties and  also a part of the profits.\n\n**This game mode is free, and each nft can fight every 12 hours.**\n\nAnother  game mode will arrive after the project is released. The \"Match making\"  mode, the fights will be identical to those of the \"Battle royal\" mode  with a little subtlety.\n\nTo fight  you will have to bet an amount in SOL (0.1) and your opponent will have  to do the same. Your opponent will be chosen according to the power of  your nft, so that the fights are fair. Once the fight is over, the  winner recovers his stake and that of his opponent.\n\nThey  have lots of development ideas for the project, whether it's new  collections, skills, PVE ... but first we have to expect that I marked  above.\n\nThe release of the project is scheduled for early January (the 5th). **Public sale price : O.5 SOL**  \n**But a pre sale is already available on the website, at 0.25 sol, and the battle royal in the warzone is already available too.**\n\n**Market analysis:**  My analysis may not be the most objective, there are a lot of projects  that come out with a P2E promise that will arrive in x time.\n\nHere, they are proposing a project which is based on this principle of combat, **and which will be effective from the exit of the project**.

With a radically new DLT that combines PoW & PoS, they introduced:\n\n* Unprecedented dual ledger (Meta-DAG + Block-Lattice) architecture to ensure the protocol scalability\n* Two types of nodes (Pillars, Sentinels) for consensus\n* PoW-Links with potential Bitcoin interoperability for power processing & security\n* Foundation for mass-scalable zApps controlled by smart contracts\n* ZTS (Zenon token standard) allows anyone to create native tokens without a single line of code\n* Plasma (an anti-spam mechanism that acts as the network gas to confer no fees at all by staking)\n\nCoin Economics & Participation:\n\nNoM also introduces a dual-coin approach with ZNN and QSR as primary assets, each with its own purpose. ZNN is used as collateral for network consensus to ensure transactions validity on-chain, while QSR is used as collateral for nodes and to fuse Plasma to submit transactions and influence how fast they are being validated by node operators.\n\nThere are three ways to participate in the network as an infrastructure provider:\n\n1. by running a Pillar node (15\u2019000 ZNN) - 80% APY\n2. by running a Sentinel node (5\u2019000 ZNN) - 60% APY\n3. by delegating or staking ZNN (1 ZNN or more) - +24% APY\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n[https:\/\/medium.com\/@zenon.network\/network-of-momentum-the-decentralized-self-evolving-superorganism-fad1de21868](https:\/\/medium.com\/@zenon.network\/network-of-momentum-the-decentralized-self-evolving-superorganism-fad1de21868)","31":"Did you miss out on making 100x returns with all the other major network cryptos including Solana, Etherium and Fantom?  \n\nWhat if I told you a brand new network is currently under development that is faster and cheaper than all of them, *and* has better, next generation technology behind it?  \n\nWhat if I told you major investment firms have vetted and funded this project?  \n\nWhat if I told you every single team member is highly credentialed and fully KYC\u2019d?\n\nWould you invest?\n\nPLEASE visit their website as this post doesn\u2019t even begin to do it justice.

Its team aims to engage users in a virtual experience based on digital collectibles. In addition, the initiative wishes to leverage the rapid growth of the Metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the market.\n\nElvantis brings a cross-chain system to the gaming industry, and its development is ongoing. This review presents the project\u2019s main features, from its ecosystem to the $ELV token.\n\n## About Elvantis\n\nTo understand how Elvantis works, one should look at all the features that compose the project. Specifically, we can mention the following ones:\n\n### Mission and Vision\n\nElvantis enters the market targeting digital collectors passionate about the gaming world. Users are aware of the strict link between the Metaverse and blockchain technology, and Elvantis aims to build its success on this framework.\n\nGamers on Elvantis will live a galactical experience surrounded by an artistic atmosphere. In a transparent move, the team has shared the outcome of the Certik audit on the project.\n\n### The main features of Elvantis\n\nThe Elvantis ecosystem is different from that of the more popular DEXs. The system is called SpaceMoonElvantis, after the contract that provides block rewards.\n\nFor each transaction on Elvantis, the network provides the following subdivision:\n\n* **60%** of the tokens used for the purchase of chests are transferred to a burning wallet\n* **30%** falls within Elvantis\u2019 internal liquidity system\n* the remaining **10%** goes to financial development and marketing operations.\n\nSending tokens to a burning wallet is a typical deflationary strategy in the blockchain. This mechanism reduces the coins in circulation by increasing their market price.\n\nThe system\u2019s Smart Contracts use the ERC-721 ERC-1155 protocols, which are very popular in the industry.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the project is entirely based on Ethereum. Instead, Elvantis is a cross-chain initiative that will support Ethereum, BSC, Polkadot, Matic, and Solana.\n\n### Types of digital collectibles\n\nWithin the Elvantis Metaverse, each user will find different types of digital collectibles in the form of NFTs. Among these, it is possible to mention several categories, ranging from \u201ccommon\u201d, \u201crare\u201d, \u201cultra glow\u201d, and many others.\n\nEach collectible has a different chance of being found in a chest than the others. Users can get some of these exclusively through presale or on the Marketplace (such as ultra glow ones).\n\n## About the $ELV token\n\nThe project foresees the creation of 150 million utility tokens in the initial phase. In an estimated 20 years, this quantity will reach a maximum value of 300 million samples.\n\nThis strategy works in conjunction with the previously mentioned burn wallet feature.\n\nThe token provides for the application of a purchase and sale fee. As often happens, the cost of selling is higher than that of buying (5% against 3%). Typically these projects use a system designed to discourage the immediate sale of tokens for speculative purposes.\n\nThere are several uses of the token within the Elvantis ecosystem. For example, the project team explains that staking and farming operations will be allowed. In addition, the game\u2019s battle system will be linked to the use of tokens.\n\nWe can summarize the initial distribution of the tokens as follows:\n\n1. **Play-to-earn** system: 25%\n2. **Allow listing** operation: 20%\n3. **Public token sale**: 10%\n4. **Development**: 10%\n5. **Marketing** operations: 10%\n6. Internal **liquidity**: 10%\n7. Project\u2019s **team**: 10%\n8. **Advisors** and **partners**: 5%\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe Elvantis project took its first steps in spring 2021, reaching its current stage. For more information, the following sections summarize the main steps of the various stages of the roadmap:\n\n### Phase 1 \u2013 2021\n\nLast year the project completed the preliminary steps necessary to start the works. After creating the core team of the initiative, the first deliverables were produced, such as the whitepaper.\n\nIn addition, the team also opened the first social channels to create the Elvantais community.\n\n### Phase 2 \u2013 1st semester 2022\n\nThe project is currently heading towards Land\u2019s first sale in its Metaverse. We will also see deals such as CMC and Coingecko listings in the coming weeks.\n\nBy the end of the year\u2019s first quarter, the P2E Metaverse will enter the alpha phase. The roadmap also includes the release of the Ethereum cross-chain in the project.\n\nWe will then see the creation of a mobile app available for iOS and Android and the in-game marketplace.\n\nBy the end of the year\u2019s first half, the team plans to launch the proprietary token on a CEX platform. In addition to the digital component, Elvantis will see the birth of physical collectibles.\n\nAt this point, the P2E Metaverse will enter the beta version. As for the cross-chain soul of the project, we will see the launch of the Matic component.\n\n### Phase 3 \u2013 2nd semester 2022\n\nThe third quarter of 2022 will open with the official launch of the P2E Metaverse. The cross-chain system will also be available through the Solana network.\n\nBy the end of the year, it will improve the gameplay with several modes.  \n\n\n### [Full Review](https:\/\/cryptoadventure.com\/elvantis-a-p2e-ecosystem-leveraging-digital-collectibles\/)\n\n* Website: [https:\/\/elvantis.com\/](https:\/\/elvantis.com\/)\n* Telegram News: [https:\/\/t.me\/ELVANTISNEWS](https:\/\/t.me\/ELVANTISNEWS)\n* Telegram Official: [https:\/\/t.me\/ELVANTIS](https:\/\/t.me\/ELVANTIS)\n* Telegram Chinese: [https:\/\/t.me\/elvantischinese](https:\/\/t.me\/elvantischinese)\n* Telegram Portuguese: [https:\/\/t.me\/Elvantis\\_portuguese](https:\/\/t.me\/Elvantis_portuguese)\n* Telegram Spanish: [https:\/\/t.me\/ElvantisSpanish](https:\/\/t.me\/ElvantisSpanish)\n* Telegram Philippine: [https:\/\/t.me\/Elvantisph](https:\/\/t.me\/Elvantisph)\n* Telegram Japanese: [https:\/\/t.me\/ElvantisJapanese](https:\/\/t.me\/ElvantisJapanese)\n* Telegram Indonesian: [https:\/\/t.me\/Elvantisindonesian](https:\/\/t.me\/Elvantisindonesian)\n* Telegram Korean: [https:\/\/t.me\/ElvantisKorean](https:\/\/t.me\/ElvantisKorean)\n* Telegram Turkish: [https:\/\/t.me\/ElvantisTurkish](https:\/\/t.me\/ElvantisTurkish)\n* Telegram Marketplace: [https:\/\/t.me\/ELvantisMarketpLace](https:\/\/t.me\/ELvantisMarketpLace)\n* Twitter: [https:\/\/twitter.com\/ElvantisGame](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ElvantisGame)\n* Discord: [https:\/\/discord.gg\/6YwurDbfRq](https:\/\/discord.gg\/6YwurDbfRq)\n* Medium: [https:\/\/medium.com\/@ElvantisOfficial](https:\/\/medium.com\/@ElvantisOfficial)\n* Reddit: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/ElvantisOfficial](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/ElvantisOfficial)\n* Instagram: [https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ElvantisOfficial\/](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ElvantisOfficial\/)\n* Youtube: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCUmWgv0WmRMzC1yEFsn6vGQ](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCUmWgv0WmRMzC1yEFsn6vGQ)","33":"**$Bonuz** is World\u2019s first Celebrity Token Launchpad which creates Ecosystems for each fan-token.

The guest speaker was Gregory Butz - Spores_Network CMO. \n\nThe AMA recap consists of interview questions by the host and answers by Gregory Butz which is the first phase. The second phase is where some questions will be picked and answered by the guest. \n\n\nFIRST PHASE \n\n\nGerald Tan - Pollinate CMO \n\nHello PoliNation! Let's Welcome @gregoryb6121 CMO at Spores for another exciting and informative AMA!\n\n\n1) Please introduce yourself and tell us more about Spores Network \ud83d\ude00\n\n\nGregory Butz:\n\nHi. My background is 20+ years of marketing where I have driven growth for brands across multiple categories. Much of my work has been at PepsiCo where I worked across many of the portolio brands and had a front-row seat in the emergence of digital marketing.\n\nOver my career, I've covered three major marketing areas of experience - advertising, brand management & new product innovation, and digital marketing. I've had the pleasure of working on some of the biggest brands in the world as well as lauching green field businesses requiring strategic non-traditional activations.\n\nI'm bringing that Web2 experience to Spores Newtork Web3 applications and helping brands and entertainment IP rethink their go-to-market strategies in our new world while we are building an incredibly community ourselves.\n\nSpores Network is an NFT Ecosystem that combines a Marketplace and GameFi publisher to power Web3 pop culture experiences:\n\nOur curated Marketplace offers three verticals for cultural tastemakers - art, game, entertainment - to drive economic activity.\n\nRepublique \u2013 is a gallery, museum, and retail space \u2013 that has been built by like-minded creatives for artists, content creators, collectors, and retailers to activate Metaverse (web3) digital + physical experiences by linking selling opportunities back to our marketplace.\n\nOur ecosystem is activated through our SPO token.\n\nEverything we do is from the lens of being Asian-influenced with Global Reach.\n\n\n\nGerald Tan:\n\nAmazing. Thats an impressive profile you got there. Such pleasure working with you in this space. Lets get on to our next question : )\n\n2) What do you think are the missing parts of the NFT and gamefi market?\n\n\n\nGregory Butz:\n\nI believe Spores is in a unique position because we aim to be a media company and establish ourselves as THE go-to partners for artists\/creators, games, IPs and brands. We\u2019re also not limited to just crypto\/NFT partners, but we have and will accommodate the mainstream looking to enter into this exciting NFT space. The possibilities are endless when a company opens itself up like Spores is doing.\n\nFor instance, we have 2 major IPs from Animation & Collectibles that came to us looking to venture into NFTs. We have 40-year-old mecha masterpiece, Maschinen Krieger (Ma.K) by Kow Yokoyma. Also, NFT Kow\u2019s most infamous Ma.K models which guarantees will make the dreams of any mecha\/model collectors come true. Another partnership we just landed is with Kuruma NFT Inc. Spores will power Kuruma\u2019s vision to launch an NFT platform where users can buy, sell and trade NFTs in a dedicated online setting called the \u201cautoverse.\u201d \n\n\n\nGerald Tan:\n\n3) So how will Spores Launchpad be different from others?\n\n\nGregory Butz:\n\nWe have been working hard to ensure that we have the most user-friendly tier system requirements that are easy and straight-forward compared to other launchpads. For example, we tend to not requires KYC. We also have a track record of success with launchpads. Our first two launchpad activaitons were for Netvrk land and transport. For each we sold $1.25M for each program ($2.5M total) within three days of drop. We also had tremendous success with Polkafantasy where we sold 90% of inventory within hours of launching our sale. Our return customer percentage is fantastic and exit interviews tell us that its because of the seamless experience, wonderful customer support, and the opportunity to become a VIP - which is activated through previous program participation - allows for non-staking whitelist activation. And finally, our upcomign loyalty prgoram lauch will offer unique SPO token utility opportunities that you will not want to miss.\n\n\n\nGerald Tan:\n\n4) What can you say about the future and use cases for NFTs?\n\n\nGregory Butz:\n\nNFTs for brands and corporations present an opportunity for direct engagement with their fans through loyalty programs, merchandising, and marketing. Brands and IP content creators now have a completely new way to monetize their unique experiences and offerings.\n\nWe are working on a ton of activations with brands: \n\n1.With Kuruma we\u2019re connecting with the top brands in tuner and drift racing to bring their fans into digital collectibles and vice versa. Imagine owning your own favorite drift car as a digital collectible and then one day being able to race that car in a metaverse game!\n\n2. We aim to have at least 2 IGO\/INO\/ IDO per month on our gamefi launchpad and we also incubate other games as well while developing our own metaverse \n\n\n\nGerald Tan:\n\n4) Can you tell us about some of your milestones and what are you planning to achieve in the near future?\n\n\nGregory Butz:\n\nTwo major developments for Spores as we seek to be known as a media company and not just an NFT marketplace. We have always been focused on gamefi and metaverse through our steam inspired gamefi secondary NFT marketplace, now we are adding GameFI IDO\/IGO\/INOs and directly investing through our Spores Capital Ecosystem Fund to bring GameFi IDOs to market.\n\nWe will have 2 phases for metaverse We have 5 IDOs\/IGOs on the way for Q1 & Q2. Another unique thing we are doing in gaming is offering incubator solutions where we invest in IDOs - and operate blockchain game studios - with venture capital style support across funding, marketing, operations, and tech advisory functional expertise. We plan to have 2 IDO\/IGOs slated per month moving forward, so if you\u2019re looking to invest in the metaverse and GameFi you can join our accelerator program and community to participate.\n\nThen we have our metaverse activation. This too is broken into two parts and by the end of the year our first meta solution will be live - Republique - a gallery, museum, and retail space. This gallery space will be used for personal expression by our artists. They can do anything here that they want. This is a space where patrons can immerse in temporary and permanent world-famous digital art and offers a section where everyday people can house their own gallery.\n\nWithin 18-months we plan to launch our own metaverse. This will be a digital 3D playground and gamified open world ecosystem where all IP and brand partners can interact with people choosing to enrich and connect between their digital and physical worlds. One other exciting thing to mention is our tech roadmap and use of BSC, MATIC; and our powerful partnerships with Cardano and Solana.\n\nPhase 1 - museum and gallery space that will hold world famous permanent and temporary exhibits from artists in the NFT space. Second, it will also be a social venue where stakers of Spores tokens will be allowed to have a free personal gallery space to show off the crypto artwork they have bought.\n\nPhase 2 - building over the next two years is a full metaverse where content IP and brand partners can interact. We hope to have Kow Yokoyama mecha alongside Todd Gray's site along with game characters from our game partners.\" \n\n\n\nGerald Tan:\n\nThats going to keep you and you team busy for sure \ud83d\ude01\n\n\nGregory Butz:\n\nDefinitely!\n\n\n\nSECOND PHASE \n\n\nGerald Tan:\n\nWe will go ahead with some additional questions. We have some twitter questions from the community. Let's have it a go, shall we?\n\n1) First one. Why should people invest in #SPO tokens? What are the benefits for investors in holding tokens ? What are the usage areas ?\n\n\nGregory Butz:\n\nThe activation plans and early momentum should signal a company on the move. SPO tokens are on a buy back program every quarter where we use 25% of our token profit to lock tokens for 2 years. In Q3 we completed a $25k usd buy back. The idea being to create positive pressure on the price. In addition, we are designing a comprehensive loyalty reward program for SPO token holders that bring utility and benefits to token holders that will drive value for holding SPO tokens. And, we also have exclusive VIP access for hot NFT drops, where as Spores stakers get VIP access to our IGO, INO, accelerator program for IDOs, access to Metaverse phase 1 and phase 2.\n\nMoving forward a specified % of future NFT drops will be purchasable with our SPO tokens. Spores token holders use SPO tokens to vote for platform governance, upgrade and development proposals, to utilize DeFi transactions (e.g. LP mining, staking, collateral lending), to monetize in associated benefits with NTFs (e.g. subscription for Elite Club to earn NFT airdrops, collectible rewards and presale access to exclusive NFT drops).\n\nDetailed info can be found here : https:\/\/medium.com\/spores-network\/spores-tokenomics-bf8763016874\n\nWith all these positive economic programs and activites everyone should take advantage of our staking programs which can be found at www.spores.app and whitelist yourself to get early access.\n\n\nGerald Tan:\n\n2) Here's another one. Can you tell us some key benefits for SPO holders?\n\n\nGregory Butz:\n\nThe activation plans and early momentum should signal a strong benefit for holders. SPO tokens are on a buy back program every quarter where we use 25% of our token profit to lock tokens for 2 years. In Q3 we completed a $25k usd buy back. The idea being to create positive pressure on the price. In addition, we are designing a comprehensive loyalty reward program for SPO token holders that bring utility and benefits to token holders that will drive value for holding SPO tokens. And, we also have exclusive VIP access for hot NFT drops, where as Spores stakers get VIP access to our IGO, INO, accelerator program for IDOs, access to Metaverse phase 1 and phase 2.\n\n\nMoving forward a specified % of future NFT drops will be purchasable with our SPO tokens. Spores token holders use SPO tokens to vote for platform governance, upgrade and development proposals, to utilize DeFi transactions (e.g. LP mining, staking, collateral lending), to monetize in associated benefits with NTFs (e.g. subscription for Elite Club to earn NFT airdrops, collectible rewards and presale access to exclusive NFT drops).\n\n\n\nGerald Tan:\n\n3) One last question. How can I participate in the sales? How can I get whitelisted as VIP?\n\n\nGregory Butz:\n\nYou can participate in a sales campaign by Spores & partners as either a public customer or a VIP customer.\n\nVIP customers can access the sales earlier and purchase rarer NFTs with higher quota. After all VIP tiers have completed their purchase round, public customers can join and buy remaining stocks.\n\nSpores will announce a whitelist event in which Spores stakers can fill in a registration form.\n\nSpores will confirm your VIP level (tier) along with your entry time & your quota for the sale after we have reviewed your application.\n\nAlso, in the spirit of transparency - we are also offering this program via BSC which allows you to save on transaction costs. \n\nYou can read more here : https:\/\/spores.link\/3GVPVOa\n\n\nGerald Tan:\n\nThis is it for now. That was very informative indeed. PoliNation, do drop in at Spores and ask your questions. I am sure you are more curious about this than ever!\n\n\nGregory Butz:\n\nThanks everyone!\n\n\nGerald Tan:\n\nThank you for joining us and taking your time for the AMA with us. We hope to see you on your channel soon.\n\n\nGregory Butz:\n\nIt's been my plesaure. Thank you for the opportunity.\n\nWe welcome anyone and everyone too join us on our Spores community. Cheers! \n\n\nThis is indeed an informative AMA which tells us deep details about Spores_Network, previous accomplishments and upcoming plans as regards the metaverse, NFT and GameFi. There is much to benefit from Spores_Network as an investor or trader, metaverse, NFT lovers, Art and entertainment lovers. \n\n\n\nCurrently Spores_Network is having an awesome R\u00e9publique week which gives you chance to see featured exhibitions from top global artists and choose your choice, also you can also complete some easy daily challenge and win some nice Spores NFT badge of the day.

Therefore, this is a win win for each network. \n\n**What is Solana ?**\n\nTaken from the [Medium](https:\/\/tradestrike.medium.com\/solana-integration-with-the-strikex-wallet-efe381bcbbdb) \u201cLaunched in April 2019, Solana is a highly scalable & robust blockchain capable of up to 65,000 transactions per second. SOL has seen a price surge of nearly 7,000% & a daily volume increase of 8,300% over the last 12 months. It is quickly gaining notoriety for its lightning fast transaction speeds, low gas fees & avid supporters.\u201d \n\nSolana is also a competitor to Ethereum with their low gas fees and quick transactions. They also have many NFT\u2019s that are having a run in the market currently. \n\n**StrikeX Wallet**\n\nDue to launch in Q1\/2 of this year this DeFi Wallet is ready to take the market by storm. Offering features such as **fiat Deposits & Withdrawals,** Portfolio Performance Tracking and Charting, Integrated Dex and much more. \n\nFor more information on the StrikeX Wallet please refer to [my previous DD.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoMoonShots\/comments\/qskxkd\/tradestrike_ltd_dd_strikex_wallet\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is a great announcement by the StrikeX team and shows us all the potential of the project. The team are willing to integrate other networks to maximise their reach and vision. \n\nThis DeFi Wallet has the potential to be the best in the whole of the DeFi space. I am very excited for this to launch. \n\nHere\u2019s to Health, Wealth and Prosperity \ud83c\udf7b\u26a1\ufe0f\n\n\n**What is the website ?**\n\n[StrikeX Website](https:\/\/strikex.com\/)\n\n**How do I buy ?**\n\n[Trust Wallet](https:\/\/youtu.be\/OX9C6-t7e-Q)\n[TradeStrike Lite - My referral code](http:\/\/www.flooz.trade\/wallet\/0xd6fdde76b8c1c45b33790cc8751d5b88984c44ec\/?refId=LFgeH1&chainId=56&fromToken=bnb)\n\n**What is the StrikeX address ?**\n\n0xd6fdde76b8c1c45b33790cc8751d5b88984c44ec\n\n**What is StrikeX listed on ?**\n\n* [CoinMarketCap](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/strikecoin\/)\n* [CoinGecko](https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/strike-x)\n\n**StrikeX is listed and available to trade on**\n* [Probit](https:\/\/support.probit.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/4408406718105-ProBit-Global-Lists-StrikeX-STRX-)\n* [BitMart](https:\/\/www.bitmart.com\/trade\/en?layout=basic&symbol=STRX_USDT)\n\n**Where can I contact them ?**\u00a0\n\n* You can contact them via their [website](https:\/\/strikex.com\/)\n* You can contact them via Twitter:\u00a0\n* [StrikeXOfficial](https:\/\/twitter.com\/strikexofficial?s=21)\n* [CEO Joe Jowett](https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/joejowett)\n* [CCO Kishan Vadgama](https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/kishanvdgma)\n* [CTO Rob Clark](https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/robclark99)\n* [CSO Jason Butler](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jasonbutler1\/)","45":"**Telegram :** [https:\/\/t.me\/BonuzHQ](https:\/\/t.me\/BonuzHQ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$Bonuz** is World\u2019s first Celebrity Token Launchpad which creates Ecosystems for each fan-token.

While we've seen nation-states and corporations alike adopt Bitcoin, we\u2019ve too witnessed the explosion of exchanges (DEXs and CEXs) and other layer one protocols like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Protocols that usher in anticipated and highly sought-after 6, 7, and even 8 figure NFTs like Beeple, and relevant brands like Bored Ape Yacht Club. This comes as no surprise, us digitizing our art. We\u2019ve digitized our information, communication, and now comes money and art (and everything else on a blockchain!). Money, yes! Art, yes! Gaming, sh*t yeah! Mash them all together and I present to you:\n\nThe team behind WarMus Land, a web3 company, is creating a comic multiverse with a p2e fighting tournament style game (think Street Fighter), with in-game limited edition digital collectibles and NFT trading cards, wearables, weapons, and land parcels \u2013 all taking place within a virtual world, in time once the project sees the finish line.\n\nIt\u2019s still very early in the SCARDust token journey and the virtual world is a ways away, but (1) the easy-to-play p2e game on smartphones and tablets (duck, jump, back, fwd, kick punch!), plus (2) a binge worthy Hollywood-produced animated comic series is pushing the envelope. And for good reason: people love anime. Welcome to the beginning of crypto gaming animation (side note: Arcane, wow). The team plans to stream the SCARDust comic series on multiple platforms and anticipates a lot of eyeballs glued to screens across the world (Netflix, you there?). They already have big exposure as significant land owners in The Sandbox, and are looking to acquire more as the project unfolds in phases over the next 6-9 months. They\u2019re checking all the boxes.\n\nTo me, $SCARD conjures up an image of a newage Capcom meets Marvel (Mortal Kombat meets x Infinity), ripe for a digital age with play-to-earn crypto gaming communities in places like the Philippines and Asia. I\u2019m expecting them to amass a community big and strong enough to boost them into $100m+ Market Cap coins. It shouldn\u2019t take long in my estimation.\n\nThe best part? The community has a charitable foundation donating to and raising awareness about mental health education, detecting signs, and seeking help. With the aid of Brandon Vera as their chairman, they\u2019re promoting mental health awareness through non-profit endeavors.\n\nJoin the team as we ready ourselves for a Q1 moon shot \ud83d\ude80 \n\n[website](https:\/\/warmus.land\/scardust\/)\n[Telegram](https:\/\/t.me\/scardust_token)","47":"\ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2642\ufe0f MetaZomb \ud83d\udd2b Play 2 Earn Zombie Shooter on BSC \ud83d\udcc8 \ud83c\udf10 Minting LIVE NOW! \ud83d\udcc8 Gameplay Video Live! \ud83d\udc8e Professional Team \ud83d\ude80 1000 Unique NFT's! \/ 0.1 BNB \ud83c\udfae\n\n\ud83d\udd30 MetaZomb features gamified next-gen zombie games, that empowers players to: OWN - PLAY - BATTLE - EARN.

This project has passed every check possible and, it's so early that I believe this is the next 100x token and NFT project. It fits the current trend for 2022. The founder is DOX'd with an actual tech company building everything.  \n\n The project is called Vivaion Metaverse. It's a 3D cross-platform open-world massively multiplayer online role-playing game. The developer has shown in-game footage of him driving and playing around, showcasing multiplayer all available in their discord. The game gives players ways to earn in so many ways. They can stake their characters at real estate to get a chance to receive rare NFT items. Players can own real estate for advertising purposes and manufacture rare NFTs for players. Those NFTs items get merged with characters to achieve even more in-game.\n\n The game's tokenomics have a deflationary and inflationary protocol to mitigate the production of NFTs. They have AI that monitors the game's market to ensure their game mechanics don't crash the token or NFT market due to poor economic conditions induced by poor game design. The founder and team will answer any of your questions, and their token hasn't even been launched yet.  It launches on Raydium DEX tomorrow via Solana Blockchain.  Feel free to DYOR. I believe this game can compete with Star Atlas, and I'm ready for the ride!

The Dough Token Management System (DoughPad) is built to provide all the tools necessary for developers and investors to track, trade and create crypto projects, whilst generating revenue for the Dough ecosystem. The external revenues are used to exert buying pressure on the Dough chart and provide holders with passive income. While these benefits are currently only available for users of BSC, Dough will be launching the platform across chains with other EVM chains as early targets, and further plans to integrate with Cardano, Solana, and Terra. \n\nThe short version of why I think this project is definitely worth it:\n- Existing tangible product to be launched soon\n- The project itself fairlaunched in September 2021, so no ICO\n- No Rug pull\n- Continuous development on product\n- Weekly AMA's in Telegram with the CEO and Devs\n- Very active community\n- Dividend payments and Staking\n- Several pending exchange Listings applications\n- And definitely more\n\nThe longer version:\nThe amazing thing is that Dough is not launched with an ICO, but fairlaunched in September 2021 and organically hit a ATH of 8 million after just 2 months. Without outside funding. And the project has been growing ever since. \n\nWith the tokenomics and the way Dough contract is coded, it is impossible to rug-pull. Besides weekly AMA's, the mods in the Telegram group are also very active and answer almost within a few minutes. The community is also very active, with regular community events. This is nice entertainment. Especially the meme contests :)\nStaking: simply put, as a Dough holder you can choose to stake your Dough and bring in even more DOUGH and BNB.\n\nSo what makes Dough special?\nDough is building a ecosystem where developers and investors can Track, Trade and Create tokens.

Rubic already allows ANY token to be swapped for ANY OTHER token on 7-8 major Blockchains.\n\n[rubic.exchange](https:\/\/rubic.exchange\/)\n\n[https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/rubic\/](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/rubic\/)\n\nThere is already more than 10,500+ tokens to be swapped with cheapest fees on Rubic exchange between:\n\n* Ethereum\n* Binance Smart Chain\n* Polygon\n* Avalanche\n* Moonbeam\n* Fantom\n* Solana\n* Harmony\n\nYou can also combine a bridge and a swap into one transaction for the user. You can trade LINK ERC-20 for CAKE BEP-20 right now for example, something we often take for granted on a centralized exchange that is difficult to do in a decentralized manner.\n\nRubic also doubles as an aggregator with 60+ DEXs built in and they only charge their provider fee on crosschain swaps so you can access Uniswap, 1INCH, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, Trader Joe, Pangolin, Spookyswap, Spiritswap, 0x and more all from one browser tab or right on your phone.\n\nI honestly cannot believe this project hasn't blown up more with staking already implemented with 80% APY (no additional minting of tokens so it is a deflationary coin unlike pancake swap staking).\n\nAt the time of writing the market cap of their RBC token is under $31 million, with 110 million tokens circulating out of 124 million tokens total. Basically no giant token unlocks for VCs to dump on you and the potential of 100x returns with its current market cap and already delivered functionality is not farfetched.\n\nBTC integration, mobile app, liquidity provision and governance slated for first half of next year.

Join our community posted below. The NFTs will be a collection of 500 which will be free to mint and cost only the price of the gas. We are undecided yet if to run it on opensea with Matic, BSC or Solana, that will all be put to a vote at a later decided by the community. \n\nThe point behind offering these ones for free is so that we can recruit as many to community as possible and give everyone a great chance, to profit from them. The early bird catches the worm. \n\nI have had some in the community question how I can make guarantees. I have made contracts in the past which never worked out and refunded people. This is a kind of social experiment that I want to spread far and wide. If it doesn\u2019t work, then I will refund the gas which is maybe a dollar if that.\n\nAnother question I have had is why buy something when your guaranteeing at least a 2x. A 2x on 1 dollar is 2 dollars. Obviously, most will turn up their nose at this offer which is fine its to be expected. But by releasing 500 with specials included hopefully the community will drive the floor price anyway and the price will far exceed a simple 2x, 10x, 100x etc etc.\n\nMost people in crypto 2 dollars is nothing, look at like this your first into a stealth launch contract and going in with very little, all early holders will benefit immensely. \n\n2 dollars a day is roughly the wage of 1 billion people worldwide, obviously not all these people hold crypto probably very, very few. If some of these people picked the nfts up for the 50 cents or dollar gas and then sold the nft for 50 dollars that can make a huge difference to families around the world. If they go more than that even better. \n\nI have joined with other successful nft projects to help promote. There is plenty of ideas still coming and there will be plenty of marketing going before the drop to hopefully drive the traffic of the first minters and the traffic for those minters to then list their NFT\u2019s for sale.\n\nAny questions join the community and I will be in there most of the time to happily answer\n\nTG - thenftcommunityofficial","75":"\u263c Ulti Arena is aiming to be the largest Gaming and NFT Market space of 2021.

Protocols that usher in anticipated and highly sought-after 6, 7, and even 8 figure NFTs like Beeple, and relevant brands like Bored Ape Yacht Club. This comes as no surprise, us digitizing our art. We\u2019ve digitized our information, communication, and now comes money and art (and everything else on a blockchain!). Money, yes! Art, yes! Gaming, sh*t yeah! Mash them all together and I present to you:\n\nThe team behind WarMus Land, a web3 company, is creating a comic multiverse with a p2e fighting tournament style game (think Street Fighter), with in-game limited edition digital collectibles and NFT trading cards, wearables, weapons, and land parcels \u2013 all taking place within a virtual world, in time once the project sees the finish line.\n\nIt\u2019s still very early in the SCARDust token journey and the virtual world is a ways away, but (1) the easy-to-play p2e game on smartphones and tablets (duck, jump, back, fwd, kick punch!), plus (2) a binge worthy Hollywood-produced animated comic series is pushing the envelope. And for good reason: people love anime. Welcome to the beginning of crypto gaming animation (side note: Arcane, wow). The team plans to stream the SCARDust comic series on multiple platforms and anticipates a lot of eyeballs glued to screens across the world (Netflix, you there?). They already have big exposure as significant land owners in The Sandbox, and are looking to acquire more as the project unfolds in phases over the next 6-9 months. They\u2019re checking all the boxes.\n\nTo me, $SCARD conjures up an image of a newage Capcom meets Marvel (Mortal Kombat meets x Infinity), ripe for a digital age with play-to-earn crypto gaming communities in places like the Philippines and Asia. I\u2019m expecting them to amass a community big and strong enough to boost them into $100m+ Market Cap coins. It shouldn\u2019t take long in my estimation.\n\nThe best part? The community has a charitable foundation donating to and raising awareness about mental health education, detecting signs, and seeking help. With the aid of Brandon Vera as their chairman, they\u2019re promoting mental health awareness through non-profit endeavors.\n\nContract address: 0xc10b30820f793e24733dc80da12c798dfbff0fff\n\n[Website](https:\/\/warmus.land\/scardust\/)\n[Telegram](https:\/\/t.me\/scardust_token)\n[Linktree](https:\/\/linktr.ee\/SCARDust)","91":"\u263c Ulti Arena is aiming to be the largest Gaming and NFT Market space of 2021.

When cryptocurrency emerged over a decade ago, the main goal was to eliminate the role of central entities in managing how we create, distribute and spend our money. \n\nGM token is a community project that was created to spread more love in a movement kind of ownership and positivity. Created on the increasingly popular Solana blockchain, GM is a cultural movement token that reflects how we all greet each other, irrespective of our race, tribe, religion, nationality, you name it\u2026\n\nGM Coin is a movement that sits at the intersection of social media and blockchain technologies. The general idea is that the price of the token will reflect the organic propagation of the \u201cGM\u201d as a social movement. \n\n\nGM SOL token advantages over ETH :\n\n- Gas fees almost ZERO\n\n- Sol transaction 0.8 SEC \/ ETH 4MIN\n\n- GM SOL MC 80K \/ GM ETH 400M MC\n\n\nToken details and features :\n\nContract address : CmSryDa4mnDYUicq7qSESsTKAdgBP26jSYcg8zavVoJd\n\nToken name : GM solana\n\nToken symbol : $GM\n\nTotal supply : 1.000.000.000.000\n\nCirculating supply : 800.000.000.000\n\nLiquidity Locked \ud83d\udee1\n\nCommunity managed utility\n\n80k MC \ud83d\udca5\n\nJust launched!\n\n\n\nWhy Solana?\n\n\nSolana is a low cost and energy-efficient blockchain that uses a proof-of-stake validation network. It means that users need to stake their tokens to validate transactions. The transaction cost is as low as $0.01, and the system can run up to 65,000 transactions per second, leading the industry. We all know the limitations of the Ethereum Blockchain, especially its expensive gas fee. Additionally, Solana has achieved high levels of scalability by leveraging the Proof of History and several other breakthrough innovations.\n\nGM is already listed on multiple exchanges with no signs of slowing down. They are working on creating a movement that will showcase the value of brand loyalties through social media. \n\n\nWebsite : https:\/\/www.gmsol.io\/\n\nTelegram : https:\/\/t.me\/gmsol_io\n\nDiscord : https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/HhpBEAfDZn\n\nTwitter : https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmsol_io un","94":"A few weeks ago we had a vision to create a token that not only benefits our community but also every single person in the world. Our goal was to create something that is simple but yet attractive. Then we thought why not something that cheers everyone up : Goodmorning!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimple but yet effective! Something we all need to hear after we wake up, some of us more than others. Even though the world is a scary and dark place, we strive to be the ray of sunshine that cheers everyone up and gives everyone hope that we can do better and make a real Good Morning out of our day. Since GM wagmi has been released, it has got a marketcap of 400 million! Such a great achievement with something so simple. This was proof that we can make everything work with such simplicity and kindness for each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are one of the first tokens on the Solana Chain. Everyone has seen how well GM Wagmi performed on ETH, now let's show everyone that we can do even better on Solana!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGM SOL token advantages over ETH :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Gas fees almost ZERO\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Sol transaction 0.8 SEC \/ ETH 4MIN\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- GM SOL MC 60K \/ GM ETH 400M MC\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken details and features :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken name : GM solana\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken symbol : $GMsolana\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal supply : 1.000.000.000.000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCirculating supply : 800.000.000.000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLiquidity Locked \ud83d\udee1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCommunity managed utility\n\n&#x200B;\n\n63k MC \ud83d\udca5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust launched!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe GM token on the Solana ecosystem. We are all human degenerates, no matter what jpegs or coins we ape into, we all wake up and say \"good morning\". Saying good morning is more than just two words, it has become one of the strongest world wide movements in existence. It is our goal for GM Solana to put the love and positivity of the Solana community (and others) on the map. Utility and use of GM solana will be decided by the community with votes. So will everything else about this token. As far as funding goes, me and the other developper have been paying everything out of our own pockets and will continue to do so!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main problem with Ethereum based tokens is the gas fees. We all know how irritating it is to lose money for such a simple task, this is why the GM concept will perform much better on the Solana chain. Since there are almost no gas fees (0.0009$), many more people will be able to make transactions. The second problem we saw was that the transaction speed was too slow for even such a huge network. And again, this is why it will work much smoother on Solana since the transaction speed is less than a second!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoin us in our movement, wagmi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite : [https:\/\/www.gmsol.io\/](https:\/\/www.gmsol.io\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTelegram : [https:\/\/t.me\/gmsol\\_io](https:\/\/t.me\/gmsol_io)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiscord : [https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/HhpBEAfDZn](https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/HhpBEAfDZn)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwitter : [https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmsol\\_io](https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmsol_io)","95":"Inanna, also known as the \"Queen of Heaven\", was one of the greatest goddess in Sumer.\n\nOur mission is to provide a solid and safe project on Solana, the fastest blockchain and the fastest growing ecosystem in crypto.\n\nThrough Partnership with others projects the metaverse with us will be easily accessible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince our project built on Solana, there is no ridiculously high gas fees.

The \nAMA session featurs Eric Hung Nguyen (Spores CEO & Co-Founder) and Eddy Lim (Animalia CEO & Co-Founder). This AMA shows more light on the partnership between Spores_Network and Animalia as well as some hint about the upcoming INO on Spores launchpad. \n\n\nThe AMA recap consists of interview questions by the host and answers by Eric Hung Nguyen which is the first category. The second category is  where 5 best questions will be picked and answered by the guest. These questions each won 20$ in SPO tokens. \n\n\n\n\n\nCATEGORY A \n\n\nEddy@Animalia [Will Never DM - : \n\nwe will first ask a few questions in category A and we will move on to category B and choose 5 questions from our community for you to answer\n\nAs you guys know animalia and spores network have formed an partnership . Great to have you here @erichungnguyen\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1 - : \n\nEddy@Animalia [Will Never DM]:\n\nPlease introduce yourself and tell us more about your project\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores - : \n\nMy name is Eric, CEO and Cofounder of Spores Network. I come from the hedge fund \/ investment banking world where I spent many years running large global investments portfolio for Nomura International and Elliot Management. I've been a crypto investor for over five years and this is my second successful crypto-based startup. I did my bachelor at the London School of Economics so I do know my way around Eddie's hometown as well.\n\n\nAt Spores Network we believe that the decentralisation of ownership and burgeoning metaverse will uniquely bridge our digital and physical lives. Our mission is to create an NFT ecosystem that is creator-centric, community driven, and borderless. Spores functions as a media company that leverages an NFT marketplace and game publisher platform to activate content creators in art, games, and entertainment. Spores GameFi solutions include activations via a Launchpad and Incubator capabilities for IDO, IGO, and INO opportunities. Everything we do is from the lens of being Asian-influenced with Global Reach.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2 - : \n\nEddy@Animalia [Will Never DM]:\nthanks for introducing yourself and about Spores\n\nlets move on to question number 2\n\n Why do you choose to launch the project? What do you think are the missing parts of the NFT market?\n\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores - :\n\nI believe Spores is in a unique position because we aim to be a media company and establish ourselves as THE go-to partners for artists\/creators, games, IPs and brands. We\u2019re also not limited to just crypto\/NFT partners, but we have and will accommodate the mainstream looking to enter into this exciting NFT space. The possibilities are endless when a company opens itself up like Spores is doing.\n\nFor instance, \nWe have 40-year-old mecha masterpiece, Maschinen Krieger (Ma.K) by Kow Yokoyma. We will NFT Kow\u2019s most infamous Ma.K models which guarantees will make the dreams of any mecha\/model collectors come true.\n\n\nQuestion 3 - : \n\nEddy@Animalia [Will Never DM]:\ninteresting! very unique indeed\n\nim sure we have alot of mecha fans \/ collectors here too in animalia\n\nWhen did Spores get interested in Game-Fi? And, what is the meaning of NFT to Metaverse? What is the relationship between the two?\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores :- \n\nWe have always been focused on GameFi through our steam inspired gamefi secondary NFT marketplace, now we are adding IDOs\/IGOs and directly investing through our Spores Capital Ecosystem Fund to bring GameFi IDOs to market. NFTs allow you to own a piece of the Metaverse you\u2019re in. Simple as that. Without NFTs, you\u2019re playing in someone else\u2019s world, not your own. NFTs bring back the power of ownership. Imagine if you get to jack into the Matrix and play there, but that you own whatever you create\/buy\/dream up of there as well.\n\nWhat's what makes me special in the meatverse. NFTs allow for uniqueness in the metaverse, a game changer really for all things digital. You can have a million copies, but there will always be a #1 of a million. I want to own or be that only one. Please join our community to get access to our IDO\/IGO accelerator programs and whitelist for future drops. \n- Telegram Chat: https:\/\/t.me\/SporesEng \n- Telegram Announcements: https:\/\/t.me\/SporesOfficial \n- Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Spores_Network\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4 - : \n\nEddy@Animalia [Will Never DM]:\nvery nice , i believe were just at the start of the Metaverse\/NFT world. There is so much more to explore\n\n4. Can you tell us about some of your milestones and what are you planning to achieve in the near future?\n\n\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores - : \n\nTwo major developments for Spores as we seek to be known as a media company and not just an NFT marketplace. We have always been focused on gamefi and metaverse through our steam inspired gamefi secondary NFT marketplace, now we are adding GameFI IDO\/IGO\/INOs and directly investing through our Spores Capital Ecosystem Fund to bring GameFi IDOs to market.\n\nWe will have 2 phases for metaverse We have 5 IDOs\/IGOs on the way for Q4\/Q1. Another unique thing we are doing in gaming is offering incubator solutions where we invest in IDOs - and operate blockchain game studios - with venture capital style support across funding, marketing, operations, and tech advisory functional expertise. We plan to have  4 IDO\/IGOs slated per month moving forward, so if you\u2019re looking to invest in the metaverse and GameFi you can join our accelerator program and community to participate.\n\nThen we have our metaverse activation. This too is broken into two parts and by the end of the year our first meta solution will be live - Republique - a gallery, museum, and retail space. This gallery space will be used for personal expression by our artists. They can do anything here that they want. This is a space where patrons can immerse in temporary and permanent world-famous digital art and offers a section where everyday people can house their own gallery.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5 - : \n\nEddy@Animalia [Will Never DM]:\nBig heads up for all artist out there! perfect\n\n5. \"Why should people invest in #SPO tokens? What are the benefits for investors in holding tokens ? What are the usage areas ?\"\n\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores:\nThe activation plans and early momentum should signal a company on the move. SPO tokens are on a buy back program every quarter where we use 25% of our token profit to lock tokens for 2 years. In Q3 we completed a $25k usd buy back. The idea being to create positive pressure on the price. In addition, we are designing a comprehensive loyalty reward program for SPO token holders that bring utility and benefits to token holders that will drive value for holding SPO tokens. And, we also have exclusive VIP access for hot NFT drops, where as Spores stakers get VIP access to our IGO, INO, accelerator program for IDOs, access to Metaverse phase 1 and phase 2.\n\nMoving forward a specified % of future NFT drops will be purchasable with our SPO tokens. Spores token holders use SPO tokens to vote for platform governance, upgrade and development proposals, to utilize DeFi transactions (e.g. LP mining, staking, collateral lending), to monetize in associated benefits with NTFs (e.g. subscription for Elite Club to earn NFT airdrops, collectible rewards and presale access to exclusive NFT drops). \nDetailed info can be found here : https:\/\/medium.com\/spores-network\/spores-tokenomics-bf8763016874                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       With all these positive economic programs and activites everyone should take advantage of our staking programs which can be found at www.spores.app and whitelist yourself to get early access.\n\n\n\n\nCATEGORY B  - : \n\n\nPART A - Twitter questions - :\n\n\nEddy@Animalia [Will Never DM]:\nThanks @erichungnguyen for answering all our questions . Excellent answers indeed\n\nwe will now move on to 5 questions from our community who input their questions through twitter\n\nwe will now choose 5 questions from here for you to answer\n\nlets start with twitter question number 1 from our community\n\n\n\nQuestion 1 - : \n\nCan Spores Network completely remove the barriers and frictions caused by blockchain technical issues? Will artists, designers and game developers be able to efficiently monetize their work?  \n\nFrom @tomie_chana\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - SPORES - : \n\nBlockchain technology is new and I am sure no single project can claim that they solved all the technical issues. However, our goal is to make artists and creators, game developers to be more effectively at monetising their works while allowing community to support their beloved creators\/projects.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\nI really like Projects that have Multi-Chain Features including yours. Tell us more details in which chain can we print and manage NFT? QCan we exchange items on multiple blockchains?  \n\nFrom @soppeez\n\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores:\n\nCurrently we have adopted ETH and BSC, we will be adopting Polygon in the near future, and Cardano and Solana is also on our roadmap to be adopted next. You can check out our marketplaces at spores.app\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3 - : \n\nIn Spores\u2019s whitepaper, I saw your that your team mentioned about the problems of NFT. The most outstanding feature is illiquidity & fragmentation. Can you explain about how Spores network solves the issue which seems to be very complicated?  \n\nFrom @muinlyreol\n\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores - :\n\nFor us to solve those two problems, the first most important is to have an active NFT marketplace with many buyers and sellers, and in the next layer we can experiment with a lot of NFT\/Defi protocols like NFT fragmentalisation and NFT ETFs that can overtime alleviate these issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4 - : \n\nMy question just simple: Will Spores Network only focus on the Asian market? Are there any plans to expand to other continents?  \n\nFrom @kazi_machi\n\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores - :\n\nAs discussed before, we are Asian-Inspired but with global reach and vision. We are already having a strong base in the US with consumers and IPs and Contents we are bringing, so that would be our next go to market. Regarding Gamefi, it will be SE Asia and India\n\n\n\n\nnice, high crypto community based traffic countries!\n\nQuestion 5\n\nIn how many ways will the SPO token incentivize NFT creators holders and liquidity providers across the ecosystem? Will SPO holders be able to generate income by staking?  \n\nFrom @AdcDavidtai1999\n\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores - :\n\nYes you can check out our staking programms on https:\/\/staking.spores.app\/ .\n\nSPO token holders and staker are also granted exclusive access to our future launchpad deals of IGO\/IDOs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART B - QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY \n\n\nEddy@Animalia [Will Never DM]:\nAlright that sums up 5 questions from twitter\n\nwe will now open up the group for questions from community.\n\n\n\nQUESTION 1 - : \n\nCan you walk us through the drop details for Animalia on your launchpad? \n\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores - :\n\nyou can find full info regarding Animalia drop here: https:\/\/spores.medium.com\/spores-x-animalia-founders-edition-nftitans-drop-details-a85efb56f0ca\n\n\n\nQUESTION 2 - : \n\n\nTell us about the LOYALTY REWARD for holders of SPO. In an environment where most are selling, holders should be positively reinforced. \n\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores - : \n\nHi Cleo, thanks for supporting us. We are unveiling the full Loyalty programm in January, so please stay tuned, we have spent quite a bit of time on it to make sure that the programm is comprehensive and rewarding for our loyalty community members. \n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3 - : \n\nWhat can you say about the future and use cases for NFTs?\n\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores - :\n\nNFTs for brands and corporations present an opportunity for direct engagement with their fans through loyalty programs, merchandising, and marketing. Brands and IP content creators now have a completely new way to monetize their unique experiences and offerings. \nWe are working on a ton of activations with brands:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1.With Kuruma we\u2019re connecting with the top brands in tuner and drift racing to bring their fans into digital collectibles and vice versa. Imagine owning your own favorite drift car as a digital collectible and then one day being able to race that car in a metaverse game! \n \n2. We aim to have at least 2 IGO\/INO\/ IDO per month on our gamefi launchpad and we also incubate other games as well while developing our own metaverse.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4 - : \n\nCan you tell us some key benefits for SPO holder?\n\n\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores - :\n\nThe activation plans and early momentum should signal a company on the move. SPO tokens are on a buy back program every quarter where we use 25% of our token profit to lock tokens for 2 years. In Q3 we completed a $25k usd buy back. The idea being to create positive pressure on the price. In addition, we are designing a comprehensive loyalty reward program for SPO token holders that bring utility and benefits to token holders that will drive value for holding SPO tokens. And, we also have exclusive VIP access for hot NFT drops, where as Spores stakers get VIP access to our IGO, INO, accelerator program for IDOs, access to Metaverse phase 1 and phase 2. \n\nMoving forward a specified % of future NFT drops will be purchasable with our SPO tokens. Spores token holders use SPO tokens to vote for platform governance, upgrade and development proposals, to utilize DeFi transactions (e.g. LP mining, staking, collateral lending), to monetize in associated benefits with NTFs (e.g. subscription for Elite Club to earn NFT airdrops, collectible rewards and presale access to exclusive NFT drops). \nDetailed info can be found here : https:\/\/medium.com\/spores-network\/spores-tokenomics-bf8763016874                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       With all these positive economic programs and activites everyone should take advantage of our BSC staking programs which can be found at www.spores.app and whitelist yourself to get early access.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5 - : \n\n\nim sure the community loved it as well and will be hyped for our INO on spores during 3rd Jan 2022. \n\nHow will Spores Launchpad be different from others?\n\n\nEric Hung Nguyen - Spores - :\n\nWe have been working hard to ensure that we have the most user-friendly tier system requirements that are easy and straight-forward compared to other launchpadds. For example, we tend to not requires KYC. We also have a track record of success with launchpads. Our first two launchpad activaitons were for Netvrk land and transport. For each we sold $1.25M for each program ($2.5M total) within three days of drop. We also had tremendous success with Polkafantasy where we sold 90% of inventory withink hours of launching our sale. Our return customer percentage is fantastic and exit interviews tell us that its because of the seamless experience, wonderful customer support, and the opportunity to become a VIP - which is  activated through previous program participation - allows for non-staking whitelist activation. And finally, our upcoming loyalty prgoram lauch will offer unique SPO token utility opportunities that you will not want to miss.\n\n\nEnd of AMA.\n\n\n\nIt was an interesting AMA session full of knowledge and insight about Animalia.

Many seem to be promising the world with no way of delivering. Vivaion is an exception, the gameplay, the capabilities, ecosystems and NFT creation make it one of the well embodied metaverse games I've ever come across.  Tomorrow they launch their alpha public game testing, where we will get to see first hand what its waiting for us on the other side.  What is incredible is the project is still very early and there is still time for the very first players to come aboard and begin to figure out the best strategies for when this goes fully live.\n\n  \n The game focuses on play 2 earn mechanics and generating rare NFT equipment. Deflationary mechanics are also a main focus so that economies within the game remain in demand. Combat and shooting mechanics were also recently added and will be in the alpha testing.

The \"Match making\"  mode, the fights will be identical to those of the \"Battle royal\" mode  with a little subtlety.\n\nTo fight  you will have to bet an amount in SOL (0.1) and your opponent will have  to do the same. Your opponent will be chosen according to the power of  your nft, so that the fights are fair.

This project has passed every check possible and, it's so early that I believe this is the next 100x token and NFT project. It fits the current trend for 2022. The founder is DOX'd with an actual tech company building everything.  \n\n The project is called Vivaion Metaverse. It's a 3D cross-platform open-world massively multiplayer online role-playing game. The developer has shown in-game footage of him driving and playing around, showcasing multiplayer all available in their discord. The game gives players ways to earn in so many ways. They can stake their characters at real estate to get a chance to receive rare NFT items. Players can own real estate for advertising purposes and manufacture rare NFTs for players. Those NFTs items get merged with characters to achieve even more in-game.\n\n The game's tokenomics have a deflationary and inflationary protocol to mitigate the production of NFTs. They have AI that monitors the game's market to ensure their game mechanics don't crash the token or NFT market due to poor economic conditions induced by poor game design. The founder and team will answer any of your questions, and their token hasn't even been launched yet.  It launches on Raydium DEX tomorrow via Solana Blockchain.  Feel free to DYOR. I believe this game can compete with Star Atlas, and I'm ready for the ride!

Both had an extended accumulation period prior to launching their respective mainnets, then ran hard in the months post-launch. Check the charts for each (box marks date of mainnet launch):  \n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe token price for each was just a small fraction of what it would ultimately become post-mainnet.\n\nSo let\u2019s answer one of our \u201creverse engineering\u201d questions\u2014how were these projects perceived prior to the mega pump? Were there bullish events taking place behind the scenes? Here are screenshots from a few old news articles I dug up:  \n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7  \nAt the time these articles were published, Fantom and Solana were barely a blip on the radar. But a quick scan and you can see that the ingredients were there for great success in the future for both projects\u2014revolutionary tech, major partnerships, institutional connections, VC funding, etc.  \nLet\u2019s go down the list for Beyond Protocol.  \n\n\n* **Revolutionary tech** that solves a major problem (allowing all smart devices worldwide to communicate and transact securely)\n* **Big-time partnerships** (Vanderbilt University, DoorDash, European Union, Gronk, Steve Aoki, etc., links below)  \n[https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/beyond-protocol-partners-vanderbilt-university-090000710.html](https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/beyond-protocol-partners-vanderbilt-university-090000710.html)\n\n[https:\/\/worldredeye.com\/2021\/09\/beyond-protocol-presents-connected-athlete-featuring-rob-gronkowski-steve-aoki-charly-jordan\/](https:\/\/worldredeye.com\/2021\/09\/beyond-protocol-presents-connected-athlete-featuring-rob-gronkowski-steve-aoki-charly-jordan\/)  \n[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/beyond-protocol-jonathan-manzi-gets-174811658.html](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/beyond-protocol-jonathan-manzi-gets-174811658.html)\n\n* **Plenty of funding** (vastly oversubscribed private sale, institutional investors including a Top 3 CEX in Huobi)\n\nDespite these key indicators for mass adoption being in place, \u201cretail crypto\u201d (i.e. most of us) really hasn\u2019t taken notice yet. This was also the case for Fantom and Solana until recently.  \nQuality projects first seek to build their tech, team, and partnerships\u2014first laying a strong foundation\u2014\\*then\\* market like hell; and that\u2019s exactly the road Beyond Protocol has taken. They\u2019ve built in \u201cstealth mode\u201d since 2018, and have since been laying the technological and marketing groundwork to a long-term crypto blue chip.  \nSo my message to you is simple\u2014get in early.  \nTheir mainnet launches in Q2 of 2022, but they have publicly shared plans to ramp up marketing to retail on Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok\u2014we\u2019re talking big influencers, and the accompanying explainer videos, tweet threads, and memes.  \nTo be blunt, no matter how good your project is fundamentally, you need the marketing and retail FOMO to really get nice speculative price action\u2014and the team seems to know this, if the CEO\u2019s recent comments are any indication.  \nI\u2019ll conclude with a market cap comparison:  \nFantom in Jan 2021: $40 million  \nFantom in Nov 2021: $7 billion **(increase of 175x)**  \nSolana in Jan 2021: $100 million  \nSolana in Nov 2021: $70 billion **(increase of 700x)**  \n**Beyond Protocol in Nov 2021: $160 million**  \n\n\n**Beyond Protocol in Sept 2022: ???**  \nAlso worth noting\u2014the closest project they have to a competitor is **IOTA**, which currently checks in at a **$4 billion market cap**. Just looking at Beyond Protocol\u2019s tech, advisor team, industry connections, and marketing, I fully expect these guys to blow IOTA out of the water after mainnet.  \nAnother important thing to keep in mind here is the upcoming January 4th private sale unlock; presalers voted to delay initial vesting distributions until that date, and I\u2019d expect at least some downward price movement around then. That being said, the team has been in close communication with private sale holders, and is apparently arranging for OTC transactions for anyone who\u2019d like to sell any $BP in January, so I think current prices are still an excellent deal. Q4 marketing should push these levels up a good deal before the unlock as well.  \nEither way, these levels will look like nothing long-term. DCA in between now and January, then buckle up for an explosive 2022.","115":"**These are my views and my opinion on StrikeX and TradeStrike Ltd. These views do not reflect on an official TradeStrike Team standpoint**\n\nBefore I start, here\u2019s a link to my previous [DD](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoMoonShots\/comments\/s3zh66\/strikex_strx_road_to_1_lambo_giveaway\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n\n**News**\n\nThe StrikeX Wallet has integrated with the Solana network.\n\nAnnounced today on StrikeX\u2019s [Medium](https:\/\/tradestrike.medium.com\/solana-integration-with-the-strikex-wallet-efe381bcbbdb) \n\n**What does this mean ?**\n\nUsers of the StrikeX Wallet will have access to store and swap their Solana tokens on the DeFi Wallet. \n\n**Why is this important ?**\n\nAs you will be able to store and swap BSC & Solana tokens all in one place it attracts a whole other network of users. It also allows users who don\u2019t usually deal in Solana to have an easier access to this new field and vice versa. Therefore, this is a win win for each network. \n\n**What is Solana ?**\n\nTaken from the [Medium](https:\/\/tradestrike.medium.com\/solana-integration-with-the-strikex-wallet-efe381bcbbdb) \u201cLaunched in April 2019, Solana is a highly scalable & robust blockchain capable of up to 65,000 transactions per second. SOL has seen a price surge of nearly 7,000% & a daily volume increase of 8,300% over the last 12 months. It is quickly gaining notoriety for its lightning fast transaction speeds, low gas fees & avid supporters.\u201d \n\nSolana is also a competitor to Ethereum with their low gas fees and quick transactions. They also have many NFT\u2019s that are having a run in the market currently. \n\n**StrikeX Wallet**\n\nDue to launch in Q1\/2 of this year this DeFi Wallet is ready to take the market by storm. Offering features such as **fiat Deposits & Withdrawals,** Portfolio Performance Tracking and Charting, Integrated Dex and much more. \n\nFor more information on the StrikeX Wallet please refer to [my previous DD.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoMoonShots\/comments\/qskxkd\/tradestrike_ltd_dd_strikex_wallet\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is a great announcement by the StrikeX team and shows us all the potential of the project. The team are willing to integrate other networks to maximise their reach and vision. \n\nThis DeFi Wallet has the potential to be the best in the whole of the DeFi space.

Everyone has seen how well GM Wagmi performed on ETH, now let's show everyone that we can do even better on Solana!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGM SOL token advantages over ETH :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Gas fees almost ZERO\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Sol transaction 0.8 SEC \/ ETH 4MIN\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- GM SOL MC 60K \/ GM ETH 400M MC\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken details and features :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken name : GM solana\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken symbol : $GMsolana\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal supply : 1.000.000.000.000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCirculating supply : 800.000.000.000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLiquidity Locked \ud83d\udee1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCommunity managed utility\n\n&#x200B;\n\n63k MC \ud83d\udca5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust launched!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe GM token on the Solana ecosystem. We are all human degenerates, no matter what jpegs or coins we ape into, we all wake up and say \"good morning\". Saying good morning is more than just two words, it has become one of the strongest world wide movements in existence. It is our goal for GM Solana to put the love and positivity of the Solana community (and others) on the map. Utility and use of GM solana will be decided by the community with votes. So will everything else about this token. As far as funding goes, me and the other developper have been paying everything out of our own pockets and will continue to do so!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main problem with Ethereum based tokens is the gas fees. We all know how irritating it is to lose money for such a simple task, this is why the GM concept will perform much better on the Solana chain. Since there are almost no gas fees (0.0009$), many more people will be able to make transactions. The second problem we saw was that the transaction speed was too slow for even such a huge network. And again, this is why it will work much smoother on Solana since the transaction speed is less than a second!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoin us in our movement, wagmi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite : [https:\/\/www.gmsol.io\/](https:\/\/www.gmsol.io\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTelegram : [https:\/\/t.me\/gmsol\\_io](https:\/\/t.me\/gmsol_io)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiscord : [https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/HhpBEAfDZn](https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/HhpBEAfDZn)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwitter : [https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmsol\\_io](https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmsol_io)","122":"Solshine Fair Launch Today at 8PM UTC!!!! \n\n$SOLS  is the first token offering $SOL in rewards to holders in BSC. \n\nSolShine is the next big community-driven token taking the Crypto and Defi Markets by Storm!\n\n\u26a1\ufe0f SolShine aims to generate a Network Effect that is going to be unparalleled in the Crypto Sphere and be the next Millionaire Maker \ud83d\udcb8 project in crypto! \u26a1\n\nWe endeavor to bring life-changing wealth to our community! \ud83d\udd0a\n\nWhy be apart of SolShine? \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nSolShine is embarking on a marketing frenzy across all major social media platforms to build the largest community in all of DeFi!\n\nJoin the SolShine Family and lets takeover the Crypto World and take our community to the Moon, Mars and then Intergalactic\ud83c\udf0c! \n\n\ud83d\udca1We believe that everyone is going to be talking about SolShine and that this in turn will create a big interest for the project in Bsc & Why you may ask? \ud83d\ude0a\n\u2022 Because we are the only Solana rewarding token out in BSC with a well picked team that possess unique wavelengths in their minds to turn vision into reality. \ud83d\udca1\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Our aim is to be the greatest token of them all!

Our goal was to create something that is simple but yet attractive. Then we thought why not something that cheers everyone up : Goodmorning!\n\nSimple but yet effective! Something we all need to hear after we wake up, some of us more than others. Even though the world is a scary and dark place, we strive to be the ray of sunshine that cheers everyone up and gives everyone hope that we can do better and make a real Good Morning out of our day. Since GM wagmi has been released, it has got a marketcap of 400 million! Such a great achievement with something so simple. This was proof that we can make everything work with such simplicity and kindness for each other.\n\nWe are one of the first tokens on the Solana Chain. Everyone has seen how well GM Wagmi performed on ETH, now let's show everyone that we can do even better on Solana!\n\nGM SOL token advantages over ETH :\n\n\\- Gas fees almost ZERO\n\n\\- Sol transaction 0.8 SEC \/ ETH 4MIN\n\n\\- GM SOL MC 60K \/ GM ETH 400M MC\n\nToken details and features :\n\nToken name : GM solana\n\nToken symbol : $GMsolana\n\nTotal supply : 1.000.000.000.000\n\nCirculating supply : 800.000.000.000\n\nLiquidity Locked \ud83d\udee1\n\nCommunity managed utility\n\n63k MC \ud83d\udca5\n\nJust launched!\n\nThe GM token on the Solana ecosystem. We are all human degenerates, no matter what jpegs or coins we ape into, we all wake up and say \"good morning\". Saying good morning is more than just two words, it has become one of the strongest world wide movements in existence. It is our goal for GM Solana to put the love and positivity of the Solana community (and others) on the map. Utility and use of GM solana will be decided by the community with votes. So will everything else about this token. As far as funding goes, me and the other developper have been paying everything out of our own pockets and will continue to do so!\n\nThe main problem with Ethereum based tokens is the gas fees. We all know how irritating it is to lose money for such a simple task, this is why the GM concept will perform much better on the Solana chain. Since there are almost no gas fees (0.0009$), many more people will be able to make transactions. The second problem we saw was that the transaction speed was too slow for even such a huge network. And again, this is why it will work much smoother on Solana since the transaction speed is less than a second!\n\nJoin us in our movement, wagmi.\n\nWebsite : [https:\/\/www.gmsol.io\/](https:\/\/www.gmsol.io\/)\n\nTelegram : [https:\/\/t.me\/gmsol\\_io](https:\/\/t.me\/gmsol_io)\n\nDiscord : [https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/HhpBEAfDZn](https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/HhpBEAfDZn)\n\nTwitter : [https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmsol\\_io](https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmsol_io)","142":"Welcome to the Solana Max Cross-Chain DeFi Eco-System\n\nSolana Max aims to be a leader in the De-Fi world.\n\nSolMax Dashboard Features\n- SolMax Launchpad (releasing soon)\n- SolSwap and SolBridge cross-chain DEX (v1 Launch Q1 2022)\n- Smart Contracts, Escrow Services\n- Staking\n\nCrypto enthusiasts \u2013 get early access to some of the most promising and exciting De-Fi projects.

When cryptocurrency emerged over a decade ago, the main goal was to eliminate the role of central entities in managing how we create, distribute and spend our money. \n\nGM token is a community project that was created to spread more love in a movement kind of ownership and positivity. Created on the increasingly popular Solana blockchain, GM is a cultural movement token that reflects how we all greet each other, irrespective of our race, tribe, religion, nationality, you name it\u2026\n\nGM Coin is a movement that sits at the intersection of social media and blockchain technologies.

It\u2019s similar to both Bitcoin and HEX which are stores of value, meaning that it pays you large returns when you promise to lock up your funds for a certain period of time and it increases exponentially. Also, stakers receive base interest and additional rising interest for long stakes. They also benefit directly from early undertakes.  \n\n\n$Daxe initial market cap?  \nThe initial market capitalization will be extremely small, and it will not exceed $5,000. This will allow for rapid value appreciation and will ensure that those who purchase it early will reap the greatest benefits. Similar to HEX, where those who invested early and with modest amounts were able to outperform later whales. All of this being said, we are not making any promises to anyone. DYOR and find out why It's important to invest in a low cap cross-chain because these factors are so critical.  \n\n\n$Daxe token allocation  \nSimilar to how HEX does have an Origin Address, DAXE will have an Origin Address with an allocation that is similar to how HEX's Origin address is allocated. They are aiming  to intentionally keep the liquidity of DAXE at a low level and make the supply economics directly benefit holders. The total supply of DAX in circulation will be 200 billion.  \n\n\n$Daxe Tokenomics  \n1. 3% burn on early unstake  \n2. 1% of Daxe Circulating tokens will be donated to Richard Heart (HEX founder)  \n3. 20% Base Interest + Bonus for longer stakes  \n4.

The rationale for KKO\u2019s value-add is obvious \u2013 global governments are increasingly imposing stricter regulations on online casino operators, directly interfering with the user experience by creating complex rules and restrictions. The future of online gambling is likely one that is decentralized and crypto-based.\n\nWhat is the incentive for users to use the Kineko platform?\n\n1. People that bet using the native $KKO token receive 2% cash back for all bets.\n\n2. KKO sets aside monthly coin emissions to reward users betting on their platform, equal to their pro rata portion of betting volume.\n\nSince launching in June 2021, Kineko\u2019s website has already amassed 5,000+ active daily users. Total betting volume in October was $6.76m ($3.6mm from casino, $3.1mm from sportsbook). In their first four months, Kineko has generated $514,400 of profit, of which 50% has been used to burn overall token supply. Annualizing October\u2019s financials, they are generating $81.1mm of gambling volumes, and $1.54mm of profit. That compares to current market cap of \\~$10mm (6.8x cash flow).\n\nKKO\u2019s success comes despite minimal marketing effort to date \u2013 strictly word-of-mouth has led to $81m of volume and $1.5m of profit. The company intends to market more following its migration to Solana (see below), which should help drive incremental demand.\n\nWithin the next 3 months, there should be three big catalysts:\n\n1. Migration to Solana \u2013 **complete!** By migrating, users save on Ethereum fees, which have skyrocketed and are cost prohibitive for what is an extremely long-tail of low volume gamblers and potential investors.\n\n2. Marketing! Post migration, Kineko will launch an affiliate marketing program. More users will lead to higher betting volumes, which will generate higher revenues and profit, as well as incremental demand for the coin.\n\n3. Getting added to a CEX (Centralized Exchange). One of the main drawbacks today is the difficulty in buying $KKO. It is not a simple process for less mainstream crypto investors. Kineko hopes to get added to an exchange, such as FTX, in 4Q21 or 1Q22. This will simplify the process for users to buy Kineko, in addition to the fact that exchanges will have to acquire large sums of KKO prior to listing it.\n\nValuation is a moving target, given how fast the business is growing. What I can say is that I believe it is incredibly undervalued. Looking at just DraftKings as a comp \u2013 DraftKings generated $1bn of LTM revenues, and trades at a 16x revenue multiple\u2026 and they lose money.\n\nI\u2019m not going to argue Kineko should be worth more than DraftKings. But it does generate \\~8% of DraftKings revenues and is profitable. A large crypto-exposed gambling business, that is actually generating a profit, should be worth a lot more than where it is today. Current market cap is $10mm, which is 0.12x revenue, 6.8x cash flow, and is just .06% of DraftKing\u2019s market cap. Here\u2019s some sensitivities on what valuation could be, based on annualized revenues:\n\n\\- 16x revenue multiple = $1.3bn valuation (125x return)\n\n\\- 10x revenue multiple = $800m valuation (77x return)\n\n\\- 5x revenue multiple = $400m valuation (39x return)\n\nThis should explode in Q4 and beyond. Enough screaming at the screen, here are the few steps you need to follow to buy the coin:\n\n1. Buy Solana\n\n2. Create a Phantom wallet, and send the Solana to your Phantom wallet address\n\n3. Go to Raydium.io\/swap and connect your wallet\n\n4. Swap Solana for Kineko. For the next day or so, you may have to import Kineko as a token onto Raydium.

Everytime you look around, another dog coin pops up. You are also aware of SAMO's recent run. (BIG CONGRATS \ud83d\udc4d)\n\nThe Dev Team took inspiration from the core mission of what SAMO was trying to accomplish, spreading awareness of the Solana Ecosystem. As hardcore affectionados of the Solana blockchain they wanted to continue to drive this awareness towards new users.\n\nHIMA seems to be doing a lot more than a lot of the other\u00a0MEME coins. Below are a couple things that I believe will differentiate them and allow them to be the first big CAT COIN.\n\n- They are already in the process of listing on Bitrue\n- Working on exclusive HIMA ARMY NFT collection (to be given out to different ranks in the Hima Army)\n- Working on adding actual Utility\n- Some cool news about Operation NitroKitty which seems like it will be biggest thing to MEME's since MEME's\n\nThat's the backbone of how HIMA came to be Solana's favorite CAT, as SAMO is Solana's favorite dog. From that idea it has just exploded. Below are some stats (and some perspective this has been trading for less than a week...)\n\nTotal Holders: 2,700+ This number is probably the most promising to me. Has been significantly higher each day.\n\nListed on CoinMarketCap & CoinGecko already with more listings coming soon.\n\nAlso already trading on DEXLab, Raydium, & Bonfida with really strong volumes for their age (200k+). Market Cap is still significantly under $10MM.\n\nThis feels like a homerun in the making (or realistically at least has a chance). It is so early (they just launched a r\/subreddit kinda early) but from the socials, trading volume, and total holders it has definitely established a footing.

While we've seen nation-states and corporations alike adopt Bitcoin, we\u2019ve too witnessed the explosion of exchanges (DEXs and CEXs) and other layer one protocols like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Protocols that usher in anticipated and highly sought-after 6, 7, and even 8 figure NFTs like Beeple, and relevant brands like Bored Ape Yacht Club. This comes as no surprise, us digitizing our art. We\u2019ve digitized our information, communication, and now comes money and art (and everything else on a blockchain!). Money, yes! Art, yes! Gaming, sh*t yeah! Mash them all together and I present to you:\n\nThe team behind WarMus Land, a web3 company, is creating a comic multiverse with a p2e fighting tournament style game (think Street Fighter), with in-game limited edition digital collectibles and NFT trading cards, wearables, weapons, and land parcels \u2013 all taking place within a virtual world, in time once the project sees the finish line.\n\nIt\u2019s still very early in the SCARDust token journey and the virtual world is a ways away, but (1) the easy-to-play p2e game on smartphones and tablets (duck, jump, back, fwd, kick punch!), plus (2) a binge worthy Hollywood-produced animated comic series is pushing the envelope. And for good reason: people love anime. Welcome to the beginning of crypto gaming animation (side note: Arcane, wow). The team plans to stream the SCARDust comic series on multiple platforms and anticipates a lot of eyeballs glued to screens across the world (Netflix, you there?). They already have big exposure as significant land owners in The Sandbox, and are looking to acquire more as the project unfolds in phases over the next 6-9 months. They\u2019re checking all the boxes.\n\nTo me, $SCARD conjures up an image of a newage Capcom meets Marvel (Mortal Kombat meets x Infinity), ripe for a digital age with play-to-earn crypto gaming communities in places like the Philippines and Asia. I\u2019m expecting them to amass a community big and strong enough to boost them into $100m+ Market Cap coins. It shouldn\u2019t take long in my estimation.\n\nThe best part? The community has a charitable foundation donating to and raising awareness about mental health education, detecting signs, and seeking help. With the aid of Brandon Vera as their chairman, they\u2019re promoting mental health awareness through non-profit endeavors.\n\nJoin the team as we ready ourselves for a Q1 moon shot \ud83d\ude80 \n\n[website](https:\/\/warmus.land\/scardust\/)\n[Telegram](https:\/\/t.me\/scardust_token)","191":" \n\n**FLOKI MONK** is a hyper-deflationary token which is 100% driven by the community and owned by its fun which the contract is already proven x10000.\n\nTelegram: [https:\/\/t.me\/flokimonk\\_bsc](https:\/\/t.me\/flokimonk_bsc)\n\nNowadays, the BSC chain is full of a large number of scams, unreasonable token economic models, extremely high marketing wallets fees.

With the rising adoption rate of blockchain technology and the expansion of major metaverse platforms, the future is undoubtedly multi-chain. \n\n\u26a1\ufe0fWith this in mind Rawson House will be releasing a platform dedicated to metaverse compatible NFT's; coupling it with a system of Atomic Swaps (Cross-Chain Swaps), which will allows users to BRIDGE ANY metaverse NFT asset, to ANY MAJOR CHAIN. This will open up an infinite number of cross chain opportunities for users. For instance; if a user wanted to swap a Degen Ape from Solana, for another users CryptoPunk on Eth, our platform will facilitate this! \n\n\u26a1\ufe0fWe will be focusing on listing NFT collections that can be integrated into major platforms such as The Sandbox and Decentraland and believe that our Atomic Swap system will help facilitate easy access for assets to be utilised across multiple such platforms. Our tokenomics model combined with the marketplace mechanics (including being powered by our own Native currency) will ensure a permanent deflationary supply, aiding long term price appreciation. \n\n\u26a1\ufe0fRawson House will be launching on the Bsc to lower the initial entry barrier for participants whilst remaining on a popular chain.\n\nJoin us for launch and the opportunity to be early on a genuine project!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe invite you to check our website and socials:\n\n\ud83d\udc8eWebsite: rawsonhouse.finance\n\n\ud83d\udc8eWhitepaper: https:\/\/pdfhost.io\/v\/PW1d7fCjP_Rawson_House_Whitepaper\n\n\ud83d\udc8eTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/RawsonHouse\n\n\ud83d\udc8eDiscord: https:\/\/discord.gg\/cqGvppYZ\n\n\ud83d\udc8eTelegram: https:\/\/t.me\/RawsonHouse","198":"Join The StickmenSolana Discord Now!\n\nDaily Competitions  \nWhitelist Spots Available  \nGood Community Always Welcoming New Members\n\n7777 Stickmen Will Be Available To Mint  \n0.3 SOL Per Mint  \nPresale & Mint Date November 2nd  \n\n\nDon't miss out on this absolute gem of an NFT collection!\n\nLike Stickmen?

Both had an extended accumulation period prior to launching their respective mainnets, then ran hard in the months post-launch. Check the charts for each (box marks date of mainnet launch):  \n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe token price for each was just a small fraction of what it would ultimately become post-mainnet.\n\nSo let\u2019s answer one of our \u201creverse engineering\u201d questions\u2014how were these projects perceived prior to the mega pump? Were there bullish events taking place behind the scenes? Here are screenshots from a few old news articles I dug up:  \n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7  \nAt the time these articles were published, Fantom and Solana were barely a blip on the radar. But a quick scan and you can see that the ingredients were there for great success in the future for both projects\u2014revolutionary tech, major partnerships, institutional connections, VC funding, etc.  \nLet\u2019s go down the list for Beyond Protocol.  \n\n\n* **Revolutionary tech** that solves a major problem (allowing all smart devices worldwide to communicate and transact securely)\n* **Big-time partnerships** (Vanderbilt University, DoorDash, European Union, Gronk, Steve Aoki, etc., links below)  \n[https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/beyond-protocol-partners-vanderbilt-university-090000710.html](https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/beyond-protocol-partners-vanderbilt-university-090000710.html)\n\n[https:\/\/worldredeye.com\/2021\/09\/beyond-protocol-presents-connected-athlete-featuring-rob-gronkowski-steve-aoki-charly-jordan\/](https:\/\/worldredeye.com\/2021\/09\/beyond-protocol-presents-connected-athlete-featuring-rob-gronkowski-steve-aoki-charly-jordan\/)  \n[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/beyond-protocol-jonathan-manzi-gets-174811658.html](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/beyond-protocol-jonathan-manzi-gets-174811658.html)\n\n* **Plenty of funding** (vastly oversubscribed private sale, institutional investors including a Top 3 CEX in Huobi)\n\nDespite these key indicators for mass adoption being in place, \u201cretail crypto\u201d (i.e. most of us) really hasn\u2019t taken notice yet. This was also the case for Fantom and Solana until recently.  \nQuality projects first seek to build their tech, team, and partnerships\u2014first laying a strong foundation\u2014\\*then\\* market like hell; and that\u2019s exactly the road Beyond Protocol has taken. They\u2019ve built in \u201cstealth mode\u201d since 2018, and have since been laying the technological and marketing groundwork to a long-term crypto blue chip.  \nSo my message to you is simple\u2014get in early.  \nTheir mainnet launches in Q2 of 2022, but they have publicly shared plans to ramp up marketing to retail on Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok\u2014we\u2019re talking big influencers, and the accompanying explainer videos, tweet threads, and memes.  \nTo be blunt, no matter how good your project is fundamentally, you need the marketing and retail FOMO to really get nice speculative price action\u2014and the team seems to know this, if the CEO\u2019s recent comments are any indication.  \nI\u2019ll conclude with a market cap comparison:  \nFantom in Jan 2021: $40 million  \nFantom in Nov 2021: $7 billion **(increase of 175x)**  \nSolana in Jan 2021: $100 million  \nSolana in Nov 2021: $70 billion **(increase of 700x)**  \n**Beyond Protocol in Nov 2021: $160 million**  \n\n\n**Beyond Protocol in Sept 2022: ???**  \nAlso worth noting\u2014the closest project they have to a competitor is **IOTA**, which currently checks in at a **$4 billion market cap**. Just looking at Beyond Protocol\u2019s tech, advisor team, industry connections, and marketing, I fully expect these guys to blow IOTA out of the water after mainnet.  \nAnother important thing to keep in mind here is the upcoming January 4th private sale unlock; presalers voted to delay initial vesting distributions until that date, and I\u2019d expect at least some downward price movement around then. That being said, the team has been in close communication with private sale holders, and is apparently arranging for OTC transactions for anyone who\u2019d like to sell any $BP in January, so I think current prices are still an excellent deal. Q4 marketing should push these levels up a good deal before the unlock as well.  \nEither way, these levels will look like nothing long-term. DCA in between now and January, then buckle up for an explosive 2022.","209":" **Solium Rise is the FUTURE!** With SOLARDEX, our futuristic DEX with an integrated sniper bot   \n (SOLARBOT), Trade limit feature, staking. etc. Solium Rise seeks to transform the world of DeFi and   \n Become the new standard.

Foxville is user friendly and forward looking platform that aims at evolving as a community.\n\nFair Comparison\u2026\n\nFoxville is a decentralized play to earn gaming platform that has integrated DeFi and gaming. It is a GameFi. It has an exciting farm based game unlike the usual old centralized free to play Farmville. Foxville has 11 different categories and 176 versatile traits. A quick comparison between the two can make it clear.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n| **Foxville** | **Farmville**||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n| Play to earn| Free to play||\n| Decentralized| Centralized ||\n| Multiverses| One universe||\n| Better visuals, AR, VR| Augmented reality ||\n\n  \n \n\nThis was a quick comparison between our childhood favorite, Farmville and blockchain integrated GameFi, Foxville.

These Fox-Farmers will be able to harvest crops, and perform other farm duties to create a lavishing farm. These farmers can then sell their assets in the Foxville marketplace to generate wealth to upgrade their living standard and their farm. \n\n  \n\ud83c\udfc6 Already Achieved \ud83c\udfc6\n\nMedia Coverage\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Yahoo Finance Coverage: [https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Accesswire Coverage: [https:\/\/www.accesswire.com](https:\/\/www.accesswire.com)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDevelopment\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Whitepaper: [https:\/\/foxville.app\/whitepaper.pdf](https:\/\/foxville.app\/whitepaper.pdf)\n\n\u2714\ufe0fNFTs Traits Chart: [https:\/\/foxville.app\/nft-traits](https:\/\/foxville.app\/nft-traits)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPartners\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Solsea Marketplace Listing : [Solsea.io](https:\/\/Solsea.io)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f DigitalEye Marketplace Listing : [Digitaleye.market](https:\/\/Digitaleye.market)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Foxville Explainer Video : Foxville Introduction\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYouTube Influencers\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2714\ufe0f YouTube Reviews Video 1 : [www.youtube.com](https:\/\/www.youtube.com)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f YouTube Reviews Video 2 : [www.youtube.com](https:\/\/www.youtube.com)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f YouTube Reviews Video 3 : [www.youtube.com](https:\/\/www.youtube.com)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwitter Influencers\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Crypto Celebrity onboard 1: [twitter.com\/ramironayar](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ramironayar)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Crypto Celebrity onboard 2: [twitter.com\/cryptobri\\_](https:\/\/twitter.com\/cryptobri_)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Crypto Celebrity onboard 3: [twitter.com\/oka\\_crypto](https:\/\/twitter.com\/oka_crypto)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Crypto Celebrity onboard 4: [twitter.com\/solana\\_daily](https:\/\/twitter.com\/solana_daily)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Twitter 23k\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Telegram 24k\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Discord 16k\n\n  \n\ud83c\udf8a Future Plans \ud83c\udf8a\n\n  \n\ud83d\udccc [Solanart.io](https:\/\/Solanart.io) marketplace listing\n\n\ud83d\udccc Play to Earn Reward\n\n\ud83d\udccc In Game Crafting\n\n\ud83d\udcccMobile Game Application\n\n\ud83d\udcccCross Chain Interoperability to support multiple blockchain\n\n\ud83d\udcccAutomated AI Bot integration\n\n\ud83d\udcccTournaments\n\n\ud83d\udcccStrategic Partnerships\n\n\ud83d\udcccMetaverse VR\/AR Game Integration\n\n\ud83d\udcccRoadmap\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 3D NFTs Tokenomics \ud83d\udcc8\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDistribution\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal Supply of NFTs 9999\n\n1st Round 2500\n\n2nd Round 2500\n\n3rd Round 2500\n\n4th Round 2500\n\n  \nFee Percentage\n\n  \nResale transaction fee is 5%\n\n65% from initial sale allocated for FoxDao\n\n35% Fox Treasury\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCharacteristics\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCommon 60%\n\nEpic 15%\n\nLegendary 13%\n\nRare 7%\n\nSuper Rare 5%\n\n  \nTraits\n\n&#x200B;\n\n11 Categories total 176 traits\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFoxville NFTs Whitelisting\n\nHow much will it cost to mint 1 NFT ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey wil be priced in different bands - whitelist 0.5 SOL and get 2D NFTs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPublic sale 2.5 SOL\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3D NFTs total it will costs you 3 SOL\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDate: 25th October 4:00 PM UTC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSocial Links:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https:\/\/foxville.app\/](https:\/\/foxville.app\/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https:\/\/foxville.app\/whitepaper.pdf](https:\/\/foxville.app\/whitepaper.pdf)\n\nMedium: [https:\/\/foxville.medium.com\/](https:\/\/foxville.medium.com\/)\n\nGithub: [https:\/\/github.com\/foxvilleapp](https:\/\/github.com\/foxvilleapp)\n\nDiscord: [http:\/\/discord.gg\/j4d3E98J9m](http:\/\/discord.gg\/j4d3E98J9m)\n\nTelegram: [https:\/\/t.me\/Foxvilleapp](https:\/\/t.me\/Foxvilleapp)\n\nTwitter: [https:\/\/twitter.com\/foxvilleapp](https:\/\/twitter.com\/foxvilleapp)\n\nFacebook: [https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Foxvilleapp-105878458535760](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Foxvilleapp-105878458535760)\n\nYouTube: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCv0ZIW3RVgThDYKkGoSEFfA](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCv0ZIW3RVgThDYKkGoSEFfA)\n\nReddit: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/foxvilleapp\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/foxvilleapp\/)","221":" **What is Super Launch?**\n\nA Startup Incubator and Launchpad developed by SL Development Team on Binance Smart Chain.

Seveets and Volo, respectively the *CEO* & *CTO* of **tudaBirds**, met a couple of years back, helping projects achieve the security and credibility that it takes to go the distance in this crazy crypto world. With a two year acquaintanceship behind them, and the brains to make it happen, these two set out to create the most immersive blockchain experience this side of the Metaverse, and born from their fusion was the **metaNest**.\n\n**The metaNest** is our go-to hub, integrated with our **nestBet system**, which allows our users to create and manage their own games, rent them out, as well as gives them the ability to create and manage their ow user profiles and avatars - *all while utilizing the metaNests\u2019 interconnected leaderboards to make it one transparent, and seamless, experience.* Within our **metaNest**, users will be able to interact with one another for a variety of reasons; whether you just wanna chat, or participate in a competitive, PVP Battle, our little slice of virtual, gaming heaven is where you\u2019ll go to get connected. \n\n**Where to play?** ***In our Virtual Game Rooms, of course!*** Whether it was created via the tudaTeam, or a community member, there will be no shortage of VGRs within the **metaNest**.

It's no wonder crypto investors are sizzling with anticipation at the prospect of tasting the riches of this new cuisine.\n\nIt'll be the place where all projects looking to launch on Velas will initially add their liquidity to start trading.\n\nBut there's more to it than just replicating a winning recipe in a new kitchen.\n\n**How WagyuSwap is Unique**\n\nLet's recap the proven and tested technical utility \u2013\u2013 some might even say superiority \u2013\u2013 of Velas:\n\n\\- Hard-fork of Solana\n\n\\- Competitor of Ethereum 2.0 in performance;\n\n\\- Fast optimistic finality (1.2 sec);\n\n\\- Highest throughput;\n\n\\- Ultra-cheap transactions (you can make thousands of transactions for $1);\n\n\\- Bridges with all liquid EVM chains.\n\nAs the first DEX on the fastest EVM compatible blockchain, **WagyuSwap will easily bridge tokens across multiple networks, faster than any other chain**.\n\nThis positions WagyuSwap to not only be the DEX that dominates the Velas ecosystem, but also the place where **sophisticated and chain-agnostic traders will go for superior technical performance**.\n\nIncubated by Bluezilla, WagyuSwap will launch on BSCPad, the launchpad known to deliver mouth-watering multiples.\n\nIt's launching at a special time in crypto.\n\nDeFi is on the rise as restrictive and ineffective regulations push people away from centralized exchanges, with **DEXes expected to take in the lion's share** of these CeFi refugees.\n\nWith Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon maturing, **crypto enthusiasts are hungry for exciting new ecosystems to explore**. With Solana's unquestioned technological credentials, coupled with the highest throughput and ultra-cheap transactions, Velas is set to make more than a few headlines.\n\nOver forty projects are already building on it, so it's here to stay. Since every network needs a DEX, WagyuSwap will have a built-in market from day one due to its first-mover advantage.\n\nAnd as the technical qualities of Velas make their way through the crypto industry and **new users flock into this ecosystem**, most will make their **first contact with this world on WagyuSwap**.\n\nDon't miss out on this rare opportunity to invest in the first DEX of the fastest blockchain in the world.\n\nGrab your prime cut of the next generation of decentralized exchanges.","232":"Elon Musk, Jake Dorsey, Mike Tyson, Jay-Z, Mila Kunis, Visa, NBA, and UFC \u2013 are getting into the NFT revolution.

The utility needs to either provide a way of passive income, a never to be seen before concept of utilization or most importantly something that keeps the hype going, long after launch.\n\nWell, enough schooling from me lol. I found a project called Fat Cat Mafia that just screams high quality to me. The visuals are top notch, the utility which consists of a P2E game and a real life stuffed animal which can display your NFT on the blockchain is super cool and their future plans paired with the low supply of 2222 could guarantee a rise in demand and therefore a rise in floor.\n\n# What they are working on right now:\n\n**P2E Game** Control the catnip control the economy! \ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udc31\n\nBringing an end to all these Monkey NFT copy cats \u2694\ufe0f\n\n* \ud83c\udf96 Holders receive a **1:1 stuffed animal** of their NFT\n* \ud83c\udf96 Backed by **big** **rappers**\n* \ud83c\udf96 Clash Royale themed **P2E** game\n* \ud83c\udf96 Low **supply** high **aspirations**\n\n  \nSOCIALS\n\n\ud83d\udc26**Twitter**: [https:\/\/twitter.com\/fatcatmafia](https:\/\/twitter.com\/fatcatmafia)  \n\ud83d\udcac**Discord**: [https:\/\/discord.gg\/fatcatmafia](https:\/\/discord.gg\/fatcatmafia)  \n\ud83c\udf10 **Website**: [https:\/\/fatcatmafia.io\/](https:\/\/fatcatmafia.io\/)","236":"Alright, let\u2019s get the shilly part out of the way\u2026 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a stable, long-term investment with a utility backbone, you\u2019ll want to pick up some bags of Dogira. The work Eoghan and the rest of the dev team are doing will add some viable competition to a corner that ENJIN has mostly covered on their own. \n\nThe latest AMA has a lot of good info about what I\u2019m going to talk about below, so make sure you give it a watch if what I have to say is intriguing to you. Let\u2019s go! \n\nSo, I said it: Bear Markets are good for everyone. \n\nIf you \u201clost\u201d your massive gains, don\u2019t worry. They\u2019ll be back. Bear Markets actually serve a very important function. Most of the projects we know and love today were found in these market turns. Why?\n\nBecause in bullruns all the moonbois and coin-flippers are looking for fast money. It inflates prices and then they get dumped on, hard. But during down market it gives a chance for serious projects to shine. \n\nSee, the issue with massive bullruns is that when everyone is looking for the hot new thing, they\u2019re missing the diamonds. However, instead of it being a thing about diamonds in the rough, it\u2019s more like trying to find a diamond in an Arctic shelf. \n\nBulls mean multi-trillion circulated coins are great for 1000x shots. Bears mean that multi-million token supplies are far more preferable. It\u2019s how ENJIN, Sushi, Solana, and other huge projects started gaining their traction. \n\nDogira had a huge shakeout of flakey money, and we\u2019re drawing real long-term investors. It\u2019s why our price remains unshakable right now. It\u2019s lower than we\u2019d like (hovering around 5 cents\/Dogira), but it\u2019s an ironclad wall of investors who believe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoin us, and experience the benefits of investing when it\u2019s Bear, so you can successfully thrive on the Bull. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pick up your coins on Uniswap](https:\/\/app.uniswap.org\/#\/swap?outputCurrency=0x4b86e0295e7d32433ffa6411b82b4f4e56a581e1&use=V2) while gas is cheap cheap cheap!","237":"On NFT BlackMarket, you can tokenize anything you can imagine for FREE no more high gas fees.

While we've seen nation-states and corporations alike adopt Bitcoin, we\u2019ve too witnessed the explosion of exchanges (DEXs and CEXs) and other layer one protocols like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Protocols that usher in anticipated and highly sought-after 6, 7, and even 8 figure NFTs like Beeple, and relevant brands like Bored Ape Yacht Club. This comes as no surprise, us digitizing our art. We\u2019ve digitized our information, communication, and now comes money and art (and everything else on a blockchain!). Money, yes! Art, yes! Gaming, sh*t yeah! Mash them all together and I present to you:\n\nThe team behind WarMus Land, a web3 company, is creating a comic multiverse with a p2e fighting tournament style game (think Street Fighter), with in-game limited edition digital collectibles and NFT trading cards, wearables, weapons, and land parcels \u2013 all taking place within a virtual world, in time once the project sees the finish line.\n\nIt\u2019s still very early in the SCARDust token journey and the virtual world is a ways away, but (1) the easy-to-play p2e game on smartphones and tablets (duck, jump, back, fwd, kick punch!), plus (2) a binge worthy Hollywood-produced animated comic series is pushing the envelope. And for good reason: people love anime. Welcome to the beginning of crypto gaming animation (side note: Arcane, wow). The team plans to stream the SCARDust comic series on multiple platforms and anticipates a lot of eyeballs glued to screens across the world (Netflix, you there?). They already have big exposure as significant land owners in The Sandbox, and are looking to acquire more as the project unfolds in phases over the next 6-9 months. They\u2019re checking all the boxes.\n\nTo me, $SCARD conjures up an image of a newage Capcom meets Marvel (Mortal Kombat meets x Infinity), ripe for a digital age with play-to-earn crypto gaming communities in places like the Philippines and Asia. I\u2019m expecting them to amass a community big and strong enough to boost them into $100m+ Market Cap coins. It shouldn\u2019t take long in my estimation.\n\nThe best part? The community has a charitable foundation donating to and raising awareness about mental health education, detecting signs, and seeking help. With the aid of Brandon Vera as their chairman, they\u2019re promoting mental health awareness through non-profit endeavors.\n\nContract address: 0xc10b30820f793e24733dc80da12c798dfbff0fff\n\n[Website](https:\/\/warmus.land\/scardust\/)\n[Telegram](https:\/\/t.me\/scardust_token)\n[Linktree](https:\/\/linktr.ee\/SCARDust)","244":"MINGO TOKEN STEALTH LAUNCHED BY FLASHY FLAMINGO NFT TEAM ON SOLANA | AIRDROP FOR NFT HOLDERS HAPPENING SOON\u00a0  \n   \nMINGO TOKEN is a meme coin on the Solana Network.

This is one of those projects like SOL, XOR or SPI that is going to sneak up on everyone and absolutely rip.  \n\n\nThis will be a long one, but it\u2019s worth your time. Due diligence on a long term hold in this market can be a life-changer. BP has a shot to be the next big thing.\n\n  \nIt can be challenging to identify gems fueled by fundamentals these days. There\u2019s admittedly a lot of foolery in crypto\u200a\u2014\u200aempty hype, VC dumps, hacks, poor marketing, etc. We\u2019re all tired of it, but at the same time, the haystack of nonsense makes it possible for legit game-changer investments to \u201chide\u201d as that proverbial needle.\n\n  \nPaying attention = major reward for the patient investor.\n\n  \n **That\u2019s where BP comes in.**\n\n  \nWhat problem does this solve? What value does it add to the world? \n\n  \n Right now the world of smart devices (Internet of Things, or IoT for short) is taking off. We\u2019re at this inflection point with mobile tech where smart watches, phones, refrigerators, etc. ad infinitum are all being built as computers. We\u2019re grafting smart functionality onto pretty much everything.\n\n  \n But it\u2019s kind of a mess right now with security lacking. Various companies are building devices and ecosystems that don\u2019t interact universally. All this IoT tech is developing in bubbles, isolated from true open interaction.\n\n  \n Basically we have a bunch of cool tech with tons of potential, being held back by corporate greed and security issues.\n\n  \n **Layer 0 tech that makes any and all smart devices worldwide to interact securely is what Beyond Protocol brings to the table.**\n\n  \n If they pull off becoming *the* standard (like TCP\/IP did for the modern internet, like Amazon did for online shopping, or like Apple and Android did for smartphones), this will be a complete paradigm shift that will touch the lives of billions.\n\n  \nSounds impossible at a glance, but so does every other world changing technology\u2026 BEFORE it actually succeeds. Then it \u201clooks obvious\u201d in hindsight.\n\n  \nWhy didn\u2019t everyone buy and hold Amazon stock in the late 90s? They just didn\u2019t envision it cashing in on its lofty goals.\n\n  \nThis is what you\u2019re looking at right here, the next Apple or Amazon for IoT. Mark my words, everything in a few years will be using Beyond Protocol for it\u2019s secure blockchain tech.\n\n  \nWill Beyond Protocol pull off becoming *the* base layer tech for all of IoT? Maybe, maybe not. We can only speculate. What I can say factually is nobody is closer right now.\n\n  \n**Just look at this insane press list:**  \n\n\n* [**Cisco Systems** partnership to enable the metaverse at the Field of Dreams](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/beyond-protocol-and-heads-and-tails-inc-form-investment-group-to-keep-the-dream-alive-at-the-field-of-dreams-301396442.html)\n* [**Vanderbilt University** partnership, development of wearable biometric monitoring](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/beyond-protocol-partners-with-vanderbilt-university-on-biometric-wearable-technology-301418002.html)\n* [NFL star **Rob Gronkowski** signed to a multi-year contract as a Beyond Protocol brand ambassador, also relating to biometric performance monitoring](https:\/\/www.foxbusiness.com\/sports\/rob-gronkowski-blockchain-nutrition-sports-medicine)\n* [Former Joe Biden Senior Advisor under the Obama Administration, **Moe Vela** has joined the team as an official advisor](https:\/\/twitter.com\/beyondprotocol1\/status\/1410281814279741440)\n* [**Cage The Elephant** lead singer Matt Shultz is an official partner, wearing a custom biometric data capturing suit to his concerts moving forward, capturing Patient Health Info and transmitting securely via Beyond Protocol](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/beyond-protocol-and-cage-the-elephant-frontman-matthew-ray-shultz-will-bring-unhackable-blockchain-to-performances-301390095.html)\n\n  \nThis is just recent stuff too as there is a lot going on here behind the scenes. A bunch of highly intelligent, connected, successful people are aligning themselves with Jon Manzi and the rest of this team\u200a\u2014\u200aI imagine they\u2019re doing so for good reason.\n\n  \nSpeaking of Jon\u2026 this dude is 27, was a big deal at Stanford before he left to found his company, and made his first million at age 16. I dug up this article about him, looks like one of those maniacal perfectionist high achievers lol. I don\u2019t usually bet against people like this:\n\n[https:\/\/stanfordmag.org\/contents\/the-company-he-keeps](https:\/\/stanfordmag.org\/contents\/the-company-he-keeps)\n\n  \nRemember\u2026 asymmetric risk\/reward. These are the bets you want to make.\n\n  \nA couple of things to be aware of short term:  \n\n\n* mainnet launches in Q2 of 2022, so there will be an eventual token swap from ERC20 to native token  \n\n* a small group of early investors (I hear around 100 people) got in between $0.20 and $1, but they\u2019re all vested for 1\u20135 years\u2026 and recently voted in favor of deferred receipt of tokens in exchange for bonus payments in 2022 (if they wanted to take significant profits they\u2019d have wanted them asap, BP is trading at $30 right now after over a month on the market)\n\n  \nI consider this a big upside, long term bet.

While we've seen nation-states and corporations alike adopt Bitcoin, we\u2019ve too witnessed the explosion of exchanges (DEXs and CEXs) and other layer one protocols like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Protocols that usher in anticipated and highly sought-after 6, 7, and even 8 figure NFTs like Beeple, and relevant brands like Bored Ape Yacht Club. This comes as no surprise, us digitizing our art. We\u2019ve digitized our information, communication, and now comes money and art (and everything else on a blockchain!). Money, yes! Art, yes! Gaming, sh*t yeah! Mash them all together and I present to you:\n\nThe team behind WarMus Land, a web3 company, is creating a comic multiverse with a p2e fighting tournament style game (think Street Fighter), with in-game limited edition digital collectibles and NFT trading cards, wearables, weapons, and land parcels \u2013 all taking place within a virtual world, in time once the project sees the finish line.\n\nIt\u2019s still very early in the SCARDust token journey and the virtual world is a ways away, but (1) the easy-to-play p2e game on smartphones and tablets (duck, jump, back, fwd, kick punch!), plus (2) a binge worthy Hollywood-produced animated comic series is pushing the envelope. And for good reason: people love anime. Welcome to the beginning of crypto gaming animation (side note: Arcane, wow). The team plans to stream the SCARDust comic series on multiple platforms and anticipates a lot of eyeballs glued to screens across the world (Netflix, you there?). They already have big exposure as significant land owners in The Sandbox, and are looking to acquire more as the project unfolds in phases over the next 6-9 months. They\u2019re checking all the boxes.\n\nTo me, $SCARD conjures up an image of a newage Capcom meets Marvel (Mortal Kombat meets x Infinity), ripe for a digital age with play-to-earn crypto gaming communities in places like the Philippines and Asia. I\u2019m expecting them to amass a community big and strong enough to boost them into $100m+ Market Cap coins. It shouldn\u2019t take long in my estimation.\n\nThe best part? The community has a charitable foundation donating to and raising awareness about mental health education, detecting signs, and seeking help. With the aid of Brandon Vera as their chairman, they\u2019re promoting mental health awareness through non-profit endeavors.\n\nJoin the team as we ready ourselves for a Q1 moon shot \ud83d\ude80 \n\n[website](https:\/\/warmus.land\/scardust\/)\n[Telegram](https:\/\/t.me\/scardust_token)","271":"**The sleeping giant has awaken.** Empire Token launched in June of this year, and it has since been one hell of a ride.

Based on voting final decision will be made.\n\nDuring a minobbery player\u2019s characters can come across two type of scenarios:\n\n1. Positive scenario. In such scenario your robber character come across a positive scenario during the minobbery and consequently it is rewarded with a rare trait, that could a machine gun, any other ammunition that can strengthen it.\n2. The second is an opposite to the prior. In this case your robber will come across a negative scenario that injure him. He might get a shot in the head of get caught by the police. Under both cases he will consequently loss some vale.\n\nBoth scenarios are completely random and the sad part is their occurrence cannot be predicted. To me, it sounds pretty exciting.

DxSale\u2019s goal is unlike other launchpads in that they are not a curated launchpad (no vetting of tokens being launched) and do not require the developers launching the project, or buyers of potential projects to hold $SALE to participate. On it\u2019s face this appears as a negative as it doesn\u2019t incentivize holding the token. However it aligns with their goal, to be a decentralized launchpad where anyone can participate and prospective investors are responsible for doing their own research. In addition to their launchpad they currently also have DxLocker which is a product used to lock tokens either for set period of time or according to a vesting schedule which gives investors the assurances and visibility of when developers can sell their tokens or deplete the liquidity pool. In addition, they have plans for additional products with DxSwap, DxNFT, and DxFarm to come in Q4. With the rollout of V3 which started August 26th In short, DxSale\u2019s goal of being a truly decentralized platform for any blockchain in accordance with the principles of DeFi and cryptocurrency as a whole.\n \nCurrently they have the following networks available on their platform available for IDOs and available to utilize DxLocker.\n \n* Ethereum \u2013 Added Feb 24th\n\n* Binance Smart Chain \u2013 Added Feb 24th\n\n* Matic\/Polygon \u2013 Added March 9th\n\n* Avalanche \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* Fantom \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* Harmony \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* xDai \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* OKEx \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* KCC - Added mid July\n\n* Cardano - Coming Soon with V3.5\n\n* Solana - Coming Soon with V3.5\n \n**Launches**\n \nThere are two parts of the launchpad standard token launch or DeFi launches. Standard token launches are pre-defined contracts where DxSale retains ownership of the contract and compared to the DeFi launchpad are relatively safe. The majority of token launches however are taking place on the DeFi launchpad. This is where anyone can launch their DeFi project and where we have seen projects like SafeMoon etc. launch. Yes reddits favorite coin was the 8th project to launch on DxSale. This platform has exploded they have had over 15,000 projects attempted launch with about 3,500 meeting minimum funds raised needed to finalize. This is where things get interesting from a revenue prospective. \n\n **DxSale's cut:**\n\n- DxSale takes a cut of every presale with a fee to list (1 BNB) and they take a portion of every presale launch\u2019s revenue (2%), and a portion of the projects tokens (2%). \n \n**Revenue Streams:**\n\n- DxSale\u2019s cut from presales is listed above however they have other revenue streams as well. DxMint which is a tool that makes it easy to create an approved contract from DxSale with adjustable tax amounts (1BNB). Token Locker (.1 BNB per lock) and a Whitelist function (1 BNB). In addition there are more revenue streams coming. Penalty withdraw will allow users who buy into a presale to withdraw their funds before the token launches with a penalty fee if after investing and not doing their research they realize the project is a scam. With v3 a few new revenue streams were introduced. Emergency withdraw allows people to withdraw their funds after investing in a presale with a 20% penalty going to the revenue pool. In addition DxFairLaunch and DxDrop are also two new dApps which will bring additional revenue. \n\n\n**\u201cWhat all these shitcoins I\u2019ve been hearing about are coming from here?! How have I not heard of this? And they have a token?\u201d**\n\n- Yes! Why haven\u2019t you heard of it? Because we have the most Sigma dev\u2019s on the planet. These guys from a coding perspective are all stars. No other platforms have as many chains, no other platform is this successful. However, they have not even begun to market. Instead, they have building, ensuring everything is in place. Due to revenue, they now have more than enough to maintain salaries for their team through any bear market. They have fixed small issues that have caused support requests taking up their time. Now however with V3 launching they are beginning to market the project to bring in more developers on the platform and more revenue for buy and burn. \n\n\n**This is where the fun begins Tokenomics and revenue.** \n\n- So why did I go into this looong explanation about what DxSale is and their revenue? Because it all plays into the Tokenomics and why I haven\u2019t sold a single $SALE and only accumulated. I have been doing this the entire bull run, felt like that meme with Squiward looking out the window at Patrick and SpongeBob having fun with their 10-100xs while I held SALE. SALE however is a sure thing, it was guaranteed to go up why? Because of Buy and Burn Tokenomics. DxSale has gone through a few iterations of their token model before buy and burn there was a clunky staking mechanism where we were airdropped more SALE tokens. The Devs however then came up with this buy and burn model and got rid of staking. This cut out the middleman causing two effects, one the initial buy of the token increases the price, two the token is then burned further reducing the supply. The net effect for token holders was same as staking but much simpler to implement and doesn\u2019t require you to stake. [Lets look at the chart as of today.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/GcK53YC) As you can see all bull run SALE has been crabbing between a low of .10 and brief highs near .40-.50. However SALE has been on a tear recently thanks to[ buy and burn](https:\/\/imgur.com\/GcK53YC). The volume for this coin is stupid low because we have had almost no new buyers due to no marketing or shilling. Almost all gains have been from the devs buying and burning the token. I outlined the revenue streams, the revenue is distributed as 50% for the devs and 50% for buy and burn.\n \n\n**Now lets take a look at revenue (these graphs were put together by members of the community from analysis tool)**\n\n[Total amount of projects that have successfully raised funds and launched \\(2% of Raised funds and 2% of project tokens split between devs and buy and burn\\)](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LcsN2Ey)\n \n- 3,500\n\n[Total amount of projects that have attempted launch \\(1 BNB Fee each\\)](https:\/\/imgur.com\/K4vZXaB)\n\n- 10,000\n\n[Monthly Revenue](https:\/\/imgur.com\/5gZPfDj)\n\n\n[Amount of money left for buy and burn from fees](https:\/\/imgur.com\/MRqcrAk) 1,297,006\n\n[Amount of project tokens remaining to be sold for buy and burn](https:\/\/imgur.com\/Laemfsz) 2,800,000\n\n\n(Actual dollar amounts higher, taken snapshot before this past days price rise)\n\n\n\n**In conclusion**\n\nAs I and the community have observed the platform just keeps increasing in popularity even through the mini bear market we just had. I have been seeing these numbers all along and that\u2019s why I decided instead of trying to swing trade other projects to just hold SALE for now. Before buy and burn SALE was trading at NEGATIVE 4x earnings annualized\u2026 which is ridiculous.  With the amount of revenue for buy and burn sitting in the current wallets spending it all now would push SALE over 5.00. Now consider that weekly revenue has been outpacing weekly buy and burns. \n\n\nTherefore I am very comfy holding my SALE based on analyzing the Tokenomics, tracking the projects progress, chatting with the devs, and building relationships in the community of whom I consider friends. Am I saying you should buy SALE? NO, I\u2019m saying I really don\u2019t give a shit if you buy SALE hell no one else has to buy SALE the revenue will keep the token price increases and the community of SALErs and I cruise to the moon.","279":"Welcome Dear Investor\ud83d\udc8e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udcde [https:\/\/t.me\/solxbsc](https:\/\/t.me\/solxbsc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIntroducing SOLX, not just a meme but with upcoming utility\u2747\ufe0f\n\n&#x200B;\n\n==========================================================\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019re building Solana defi infrastructure to make it more friendly to BSC\/ETH investors.

The developer has shown in-game footage of him driving and playing around, showcasing multiplayer all available in their discord. The game gives players ways to earn in so many ways. They can stake their characters at real estate to get a chance to receive rare NFT items. Players can own real estate for advertising purposes and manufacture rare NFTs for players. Those NFTs items get merged with characters to achieve even more in-game.\n\n The game's tokenomics have a deflationary and inflationary protocol to mitigate the production of NFTs. They have AI that monitors the game's market to ensure their game mechanics don't crash the token or NFT market due to poor economic conditions induced by poor game design. The founder and team will answer any of your questions, and their token hasn't even been launched yet.  It launches on Raydium DEX tomorrow via Solana Blockchain.  Feel free to DYOR. I believe this game can compete with Star Atlas, and I'm ready for the ride! The game and tokenomics are perfect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTelegram: [https:\/\/t.me\/vivaion](https:\/\/t.me\/vivaion) \n\nWebsite: [https:\/\/vivaion.com](https:\/\/vivaion.com)","281":" \n\n**This is one of those projects like SOL, XOR or SPI that is going to sneak up on everyone and absolutely rip.**  \n\n\nThis will be a long one, but it\u2019s worth your time. Due diligence on a long term hold in this market can be a life-changer. And I think BP has a shot to be the next big thing.\n\nAsymmetric risk\/reward, right?\n\nAnyways, it can be challenging to identify actual gems fueled by fundamentals these days. There\u2019s admittedly a lot of foolery in crypto\u200a\u2014\u200aempty hype, VC dumps, hacks, poor marketing, etc. We\u2019re all tired of it, but at the same time, the haystack of nonsense makes it possible for legit game-changer investments to \u201chide\u201d as that proverbial needle.\n\nPaying attention = major come-ups for the patient investor.  \n\n\n**Enter BP.**  **\ud83d\udcc8** \n\n  \nFirstly, what problem does this solve? What value does it add to the world? \n\nRight now, the world of smart devices (Internet of Things, or IoT for short) is taking off. We\u2019re at this inflection point with mobile tech, where smart watches, phones, refrigerators, etc. ad infinitum are all being built as computers. We\u2019re grafting smart functionality onto pretty much everything.\n\nBut it\u2019s kind of a mess right now. Various companies are building devices and ecosystems that don\u2019t interact universally. All this IoT tech is developing in bubbles, isolated from true open interaction.\n\nBasically we have a bunch of cool tech with tons of potential, being held back by corporate greed and security issues.\n\n**Beyond Protocol is a Layer 0 tech that enables any and all smart devices worldwide to interact securely.**\n\nIf they pull off becoming *the* standard (like TCP\/IP did for the modern internet, like Amazon did for online shopping, or like Apple and Android did for smartphones), this will be a complete paradigm shift that will touch the lives of billions.\n\nSo yeah, there\u2019s your hype. Sounds far-fetched at a glance, but so does every other world changing technology\u2026 BEFORE it actually succeeds. Then it \u201clooks obvious\u201d in hindsight.\n\nThis is why most people didn\u2019t buy and hold Amazon stock in the late 90s. Just didn\u2019t envision it cashing in on its lofty goals.\n\nWill Beyond Protocol pull off becoming *the* base layer tech for all of IoT? Maybe, maybe not. But nobody is closer right now.\n\n**Nobody is here, ready with the tech, and making the right connections in business, academia, and politics:**\n\n* [**Cisco Systems** partnership to enable the metaverse at the Field of Dreams](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/beyond-protocol-and-heads-and-tails-inc-form-investment-group-to-keep-the-dream-alive-at-the-field-of-dreams-301396442.html)\n* [**Vanderbilt University** partnership, development of wearable biometric monitoring](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/beyond-protocol-partners-with-vanderbilt-university-on-biometric-wearable-technology-301418002.html)\n* [NFL star **Rob Gronkowski** signed to a multi-year contract as a Beyond Protocol brand ambassador, also relating to biometric performance monitoring](https:\/\/www.foxbusiness.com\/sports\/rob-gronkowski-blockchain-nutrition-sports-medicine)\n* [Former Joe Biden Senior Advisor under the Obama Administration, **Moe Vela** has joined the team as an official advisor](https:\/\/twitter.com\/beyondprotocol1\/status\/1410281814279741440)\n* [**Cage The Elephant** lead singer Matt Shultz is an official partner, wearing a custom biometric data capturing suit to his concerts moving forward, capturing Patient Health Info and transmitting securely via Beyond Protocol](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/beyond-protocol-and-cage-the-elephant-frontman-matthew-ray-shultz-will-bring-unhackable-blockchain-to-performances-301390095.html)\n\n  \nThis is just recent stuff too, there\u2019s a lot going on here behind the scenes.

I dug up this article about him, looks like one of those maniacal perfectionist high achievers lol. I don\u2019t usually bet against people like this:\n\n  \n[https:\/\/stanfordmag.org\/contents\/the-company-he-keeps](https:\/\/stanfordmag.org\/contents\/the-company-he-keeps)\n\n  \nRemember\u2026 asymmetric risk\/reward. These are the bets you want to make.\n\nA couple of things to be aware of short term:\n\n* mainnet launches in Q2 of 2022, so there will be an eventual token swap from ERC20 to native token\n* a small group of early investors (I hear around 100 people) got in between $0.20 and $1, but they\u2019re all vested for 1\u20135 years\u2026 and recently voted in favor of deferred receipt of tokens in exchange for bonus payments in 2022 (if they wanted to take significant profits they\u2019d have wanted them asap, BP is trading at $30 right now after over a month on the market)\n\n  \nUltimately, I consider this a big upside long term bet. I\u2019d look to accumulate a nice chunk before mainnet, then just forget about it for a while\u2026 projects with strong fundamentals tend to do really well once the tech actually launches. Again, think Solana, Cardano, etc. Heck, even the run-up in anticipation of launch can be explosive (Vectorspace AI recently).\n\n  \nDon\u2019t let this be one of those projects you heard about and never acted on, then see it way up in a few months. Consider this your early heads up.  **\ud83d\udcc8**","282":"\ud83e\udd96 BezosZilla was designed to be a unique, one-of-a-kind project.

FSD Coin fulfills the dream of bringing crypto to people around the world in an easy way.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 PUBLIC WHITELIST PRIVATE IS LIVE! \n\nPrivate sale public ends Oct 17th, UTC 12:00 or when hardcap is reached.\n\n\ud83d\udd38JOIN THE PRIVATE SALE HERE: \n\nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfL642OTQ4kxvgHrDfienuwvwlgINI20K4wh9hihDWM-vHulg\/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Whitelist private\n\n\ud83c\udf97Supply 1.000.000.000\n\n\ud83c\udf21HC 50 Bnb\n\n\ud83e\uddf71 bnb 1.000.000 FSD\n\ud83d\udd39Min buy 1 Bnb\n\ud83d\udd39Max buy 2 bnb\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fPRESALE PUBLIC Oct 18 th\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f1 bnb 850.000 FSD\n\u25aa\ufe0fMin buy 0.1 nb\n\u25aa\ufe0fMax buy 2 bnb\n\nLINK PRESALE (PINKSALE)\nhttps:\/\/www.pinksale.finance\/#\/launchpad\/0x643C741098E82d082258C9F96EAD5DB0D84F8F82?chain=BSC\n\n\ud83c\udf97Tokenomic \n\n\ud83d\udc47Tax : 8%\n\n\ud83d\udccaBuyback 2% \n\ud83d\udd16Marketing 2% \n\ud83e\uddeaDevelopment project 1% \n\ud83d\udd25Burn 1% \n\ud83d\udec1Liquidity pool 2%\n\n\ud83d\udd10 LP LOCK 1 YEARS ON PINKSALE\n\n\ud83d\ude80Launch on PancakeSwap: Oct 19 th\n\n\ud83d\ude80Unique MARKETPLACE\n\nWebsite http:\/\/fsdcoin.com\/\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/FSD_Coin?t=3OEOIKBsc6ioFlXfIYr3TA&s=09\nTG : https:\/\/t.me\/Fsdcoinofficial","289":" **$FDE** \\- FlexDefi Platform offers cross-chain bridge\/multi-chain services like Swapping, automated market-making, decentralized exchange for the Binance, Polygon, Ethereum Solana, Fantom, Avalanche.

The Dough Token Management System (DoughPad) is built to provide all the tools necessary for developers and investors to track, trade and create crypto projects, whilst generating revenue for the Dough ecosystem. The external revenues are used to exert buying pressure on the Dough chart and provide holders with passive income. While these benefits are currently only available for users of BSC, Dough will be launching the platform across chains with other EVM chains as early targets, and further plans to integrate with Cardano, Solana, and Terra. \n\nThe short version of why I think this project is definitely worth it:\n- Existing tangible product to be launched soon\n- The project itself fairlaunched in September 2021, so no ICO\n- No Rug pull\n- Continuous development on product\n- Weekly AMA's in Telegram with the CEO and Devs\n- Very active community\n- Dividend payments and Staking\n- Several pending exchange Listings applications\n- And definitely more\n\nThe longer version:\nThe amazing thing is that Dough is not launched with an ICO, but fairlaunched in September 2021 and organically hit a ATH of 8 million after just 2 months. Without outside funding. And the project has been growing ever since. \n\nWith the tokenomics and the way Dough contract is coded, it is impossible to rug-pull. Besides weekly AMA's, the mods in the Telegram group are also very active and answer almost within a few minutes. The community is also very active, with regular community events. This is nice entertainment. Especially the meme contests :)\nStaking: simply put, as a Dough holder you can choose to stake your Dough and bring in even more DOUGH and BNB.\n\nSo what makes Dough special?\nDough is building a ecosystem where developers and investors can Track, Trade and Create tokens.

Up, down and sideways, influenced by a variety of dudes and nations. Been one hell of a roller-coaster ride, but I don\u2019t think the markets are going to get bearish anytime soon. I am a gem hunter. Nothing gives me satisfaction like the thrill of hunting down that next 100x in a sea of scams and moonshots. Ive gotten lucky quite a few times and I do not think my luck is going to run out anytime soon. Especially with SolSports.\n\nWhat is SolSports? They describe themselves as a decentralized bet-maker, tournament organizer and NFT marketplace for the E-sports community. They have 4 core products, whose beta versions will be released in the coming months:\n\u25fb\ufe0f Bet Maker \u2013 Allows you to bet against anyone in games such as Dota 2, CS:GO, etc.\n\u25fb\ufe0f Pitch Bet \u2013 Make your betting track-record public, so others can piggy-back on your bets for a fee.\n\u25fb\ufe0f E-Sports Organizer \u2013 Host your own tournaments and organize bets around it.\n\u25fb\ufe0f NFT Marketplace \u2013 Mint your own NFTS. A good add-on for gamers and tournament creators.\n\nAll these products will use the SolSports token in order to unlock their value. If this does not scream use-case, I don\u2019t know what does.\n\nThe platform itself will be built on Solana in order to take advantage of insane transaction speeds and dirt-cheap fees. They are doing a partial token sale on BSC too, in order to steal and onboard some of those BSC defi-users. I think it\u2019s a brilliant strategy, BSC is indeed a juicy market and a gigantic DEFI hub.\n\nWhat games will SolSports support?\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Dota 2 (first game to be supported)\n\u2611\ufe0f Valorant\n\u2611\ufe0f CS:GO\n\u2611\ufe0f Hearthstone \n\nIn addition to this, they have identified 12 more games that will be integrated with Bet Maker and our other products, which will be revealed through partnership announcements. \n\nThey also plan to make SolSports the go-to platform for e-sports wagering, all done through the SolSports token. Check out their website and read the official documentation to learn more.\n\nWhat really excites me are the industries they are operating in: Gaming and betting. They are both mammoth industries, with market sizes of around$65 billion and $200 billion respectively. If SolSports manages to drive just 0.01% of these industry\u2019s participants to use their platform, how much do you think SolSports will be worth?  And the fun part is, their token sale is still ongoing. You can get in on the ground floor. At minimum, looks like a 20x to me.\n\nAlways DYOR, here are the links for that:\n\nLinks: \n\ud83d\udd17 Website: http:\/\/www.solsports.io\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/solsports_io\n\ud83d\udd17 Docs: docs.solsports.io\n\ud83d\udd17 Telegram: https:\/\/t.me\/SolSports\n\nHere is the direct link to their publics sale:\nhttps:\/\/app.unicrypt.network\/amm\/pancake-v2\/ilo\/0x7ac8525df14c3bf150Eca00389040f1f740dbbbf","299":"Rotten Floki\ud83d\ude80\n\nWe are creating a virtual environment where users may create, control, and monetize game experiences with NFTs and the platform's utility token \u2013 Rotten. $Rotten is an immutable BEP-20 token that will be used for purchasing digital goods and services in the ecosystem.\n\n2% Rewards paid to everyone in $FLOKI.

However, to ensure the new contract is safe for users. We have decided to proceed to an audit with Certik \u2014 the most popular and renowned Audit agency and we have already received a preliminary report.\n\n \n\nAs you can see in the attached file, there are no critical issues with the contract, but only a major vulnerability, a few minor redundant codes, and informational issues that won\u2019t have any impact on the contract.\n\n**GLOBAL-01 | Centralization Related Risks**\n\nThis function for withdraw irrelevant tokens to keep our contract address holding clean on bsc scan.

Rather than merely checking for bugs and vulnerabilities, Formal Verification leverages rigorous mathematical theorems to check whether the source code of a program meets its specification, computing all possible scenarios and proving that it is impossible for certain checked vulnerabilities to exist. CertiK has conducted audit reports for $SSD, and the report confirms that it has passed the audit requirements with over a 98% rating.\n\nMalicious hackers have plagued the blockchain space and stifled the growth of many promising projects. By conducting Formal Verification audits on projects like Secretworld, CertiK aims to guard against some of the most frequent and critical vulnerabilities that have been the source of these attacks. Together, both organizations envision a safer blockchain ecosystem with higher security standards that would prevent against many of the hacks of the past.\n\nFor detailed audit report please refer to audit page:\n\n[https:\/\/www.certik.com\/projects\/secretworld](https:\/\/www.certik.com\/projects\/secretworld)\n\n# About Secretworld.network\n\nSecret world is a virtual universe where members can play, earn and own digital content in the secret society universe supported by Binance smart chain.

This is a major milestone for StrikeX Technologies Ltd. and the project as a whole. \n\n**What does ETH offer ?**\n\nEthereum offers \u201cthe ability to enable the deployment of smart contracts and decentralised applications without interference.\u201d - [Medium](https:\/\/medium.com\/tradestrike\/ethereum-integration-officially-announced-for-the-strikex-wallet-31dc4f53342) \n\nEthereum is essential in the crypto space and has an immense amount of use cases.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWith the integration of ETH, this creates more solidarity to the StrikeX Wallet and brings many more eyes to the project. \n\nWith having ETH, BTC, BSC and SOL all integrated at launch, that is an estimated combined holder base of over 350,000,000 unique wallets. \n\nI personally feel that this StrikeX Wallet will be huge.

Each nft has different stats (hp, defense, attack, energy, dodge, and critical hit) which are fueled by their attributes.\n\nThe objective is to fight against other players in a \"Battle royal\" mode to win the fights.\n\nThe  clashes are in 1v1 (for the moment) turn-based and the winner gets a  reward in SOL from a wallet which is fed with 80% of the royalties and  also a part of the profits.\n\n**This game mode is free, and each nft can fight every 12 hours.**\n\nAnother  game mode will arrive after the project is released. The \"Match making\"  mode, the fights will be identical to those of the \"Battle royal\" mode  with a little subtlety.\n\nTo fight  you will have to bet an amount in SOL (0.1) and your opponent will have  to do the same. Your opponent will be chosen according to the power of  your nft, so that the fights are fair. Once the fight is over, the  winner recovers his stake and that of his opponent.\n\nThey  have lots of development ideas for the project, whether it's new  collections, skills, PVE ... but first we have to expect that I marked  above.\n\nThe release of the project is scheduled for early January (the 5th). **Public sale price : O.5 SOL**  \n**But a pre sale is already available on the website, at 0.25 sol, and the battle royal in the warzone is already available too.**\n\n**Market analysis:**  My analysis may not be the most objective, there are a lot of projects  that come out with a P2E promise that will arrive in x time.\n\nHere, they are proposing a project which is based on this principle of combat, **and which will be effective from the exit of the project**.

In comparison to Sol (another high TPS non-shard), cost of running a node is transparent and extremely low, which avoids all the \u201ccentralised\u201d data-centre issues of SOL.. e.g. this already has >1k nodes and they haven\u2019t really launched yet, vs Solana\u2019s ~600 where most are hosted by VC\/team.\n\nExpecting details of launch, marketing, and exchange listing details very soon. Announcement should also include confirmation they will finally add liquidity to Uniswap pool (liquidity is the biggest hurdle right now)....\n\nSo they are in \u201cbeta\u201d but have had the main DLT live testing and improving for ~2 years, stable and operating at 666 TPS (10k planned on V1 launch \u2013 Ethereum is 30 TPS). Also have a content delivery network S2 built on top for a completely decentralised and fully encrypted\/private end-to-end data transmission, with speeds easily capable of 4k video streaming, gaming, cloud services, VOIP\/video calls, messenger etc. \n\nAlready have an in-house fully encrypted & decentralised messenger\/VOIP dApp for both IOS & android which is dope, and soon being expanded to be a platform for include gaming, social media, video content live streaming, etc....

We are both currently doing our DD, but wondering what everyone else in this subreddit thinks.\n\nI assume this tech is similar to mining, but overall the concept seems pretty cool.  \nTeam seems to be doxxed, and the whitepaper has some noteable people as investors and appeared on national news. Seems to be checking off the green checkmarks so far.\n\nCan anyone explain to me how this WON'T be big in the future, especially with the pandemic inevitably ending and people heading back to the gyms? Someone play devil's advocate for me here, from a real-world use, how does this coin not just trump things like Shiba?\n\nFrom my understanding, they are the only coin that is actually going to really tie into a physical product, and you will be able to ride a bike, which generates the coin. Yes, I get this is not really the decentralization people were looking for, but look at Solana. Everyone thought SOL would be super decentralized, but I believe it's actually one of the most centralized in the top 50. \n\nThe only downside is that they currently aren't listed on any big exchanges, which tells me that this project is early enough to get in on and really be a moonshot.

This means that they will use the money from the tax for reflection to buy this partner token on the market in order to offer it in reflection to their holders, in parallel, this will cause an obvious increase in the price of the partner token due to the buy-back. This is a never-before-seen business model and a very smart one. In addition, Astroshit will offer unique, beautiful NFTs as part of the project. These are 10,000 totally unique, high-quality NFTs that will be mintable on their bespoke site and tradeable on the biggest NFT platforms.

It also allows users who don\u2019t usually deal in Solana to have an easier access to this new field and vice versa. Therefore, this is a win win for each network. \n\n**What is Solana ?**\n\nTaken from the [Medium](https:\/\/tradestrike.medium.com\/solana-integration-with-the-strikex-wallet-efe381bcbbdb) \u201cLaunched in April 2019, Solana is a highly scalable & robust blockchain capable of up to 65,000 transactions per second. SOL has seen a price surge of nearly 7,000% & a daily volume increase of 8,300% over the last 12 months. It is quickly gaining notoriety for its lightning fast transaction speeds, low gas fees & avid supporters.\u201d \n\nSolana is also a competitor to Ethereum with their low gas fees and quick transactions. They also have many NFT\u2019s that are having a run in the market currently. \n\n**StrikeX Wallet**\n\nDue to launch in Q1\/2 of this year this DeFi Wallet is ready to take the market by storm.

Our goal was to create something that is simple but yet attractive. Then we thought why not something that cheers everyone up : Goodmorning!\n\nSimple but yet effective! Something we all need to hear after we wake up, some of us more than others. Even though the world is a scary and dark place, we strive to be the ray of sunshine that cheers everyone up and gives everyone hope that we can do better and make a real Good Morning out of our day. Since GM wagmi has been released, it has got a marketcap of 400 million! Such a great achievement with something so simple. This was proof that we can make everything work with such simplicity and kindness for each other.\n\nWe are one of the first tokens on the Solana Chain. Everyone has seen how well GM Wagmi performed on ETH, now let's show everyone that we can do even better on Solana!\n\nGM SOL token advantages over ETH :\n\n\\- Gas fees almost ZERO\n\n\\- Sol transaction 0.8 SEC \/ ETH 4MIN\n\n\\- GM SOL MC 60K \/ GM ETH 400M MC\n\nToken details and features :\n\nToken name : GM solana\n\nToken symbol : $GMsolana\n\nTotal supply : 1.000.000.000.000\n\nCirculating supply : 800.000.000.000\n\nLiquidity Locked \ud83d\udee1\n\nCommunity managed utility\n\n63k MC \ud83d\udca5\n\nJust launched!\n\nThe GM token on the Solana ecosystem. We are all human degenerates, no matter what jpegs or coins we ape into, we all wake up and say \"good morning\". Saying good morning is more than just two words, it has become one of the strongest world wide movements in existence. It is our goal for GM Solana to put the love and positivity of the Solana community (and others) on the map. Utility and use of GM solana will be decided by the community with votes. So will everything else about this token. As far as funding goes, me and the other developper have been paying everything out of our own pockets and will continue to do so!\n\nThe main problem with Ethereum based tokens is the gas fees.

This team knows what they are doing and they are pulling together all of the necessary elements to ensure a meteoric launch tomorrow! Not to mention, ICEBERG is aiming to have the fairest, cleanest launch on the Binance Smart Chain this year.  *ICEBERG will certainly benefit* from the big ideas and proven track record of this very capable team! \n\n\ud83d\udc8e**Hyper-Deflationary Token**\n\nIn the dictionary the term *hyper-deflationary should have ICEBERG next to it!* Seriously. **ICEBERG is built to burn!** When a token burns like this it\u2019s hard not to consider that it is going to have a  bright future price! In crypto language that means x\u2019s!\n\nThere are ***THREE Burn Mechanisms***!\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Supply Burns**: 50% of token supply will be burned, 1% daily for 50 days straight! Burn ICEBERG, burn!\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Transaction Burns**: As released in the contents of the white paper, 1% of all buys and sells will go to a *BuyBack* wallet that will be used for ***burns and strategic buybacks*** that positively impact price.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Utility burns**: The ICEBERG Protocol is available as a paid service. Each time the *Auto-Vest-And-Burn* Protocol is utilized by a client ***ICEBERG*** ***will be burned***!\n\n\ud83d\udc8e **Innovative UTILITY**\n\nAs mentioned above, the ICEBERG Protocol is an Auto-Vest-And-Burn mechanism.

The resourcefulness and experience of the team has created an environment which benefits from existing partnerships that empower them to get things done quickly. It\u2019s no wonder their first project soared to a $112 million dollar market cap in less than7 days after launch.\n\nAs if those aren\u2019t enough reasons, the team also announced *huge marketing plans and a VERY sizable budget* for marketing after the fair launch on Monday!  Partnerships, influencers, organic, growing community, already-developed utility, multiple burn mechanisms, over 50% of supply burned in the first month and a half.

Their goal is to create highly innovative projects and solve liquidity-related issues that stifle many projects in the DeFi space.\n\n**What is the Iceberg Protocol?**\n\nThe ICEBERG Protocol is a game-changing Protocol that enables Smart Supply Management through a process of Auto-Vesting and Burning tokens on a predefined schedule. The tokens are secured in a Smart Contract whose sole function is to \u2018Burn\u2019. They are locked and vested for a predetermined period of time and a percentage of the tokens are burned on Schedule. This enables a consistent decrease in the supply of tokens and an equally consistent increase of the price of the token.\n\n**Have the founders been doxxed?**\n\nCo-founder and CEO Frank has been fully doxxed and was an award-winning Speaker at the Dubai Crypto Conference in Dubai in 2021 as well as a featured speaker at Dubai DeFi Conference. \n\n**What are $ICEBERG Tokenomics.**\n\n*7% tax on Buys*\n\n6% - for ICEBERG Labs (LP, Marketing and Development)\n\n1% - Buyback\n\n*10% tax on Sales*\n\n9% - ICEBERG Labs (LP, Marketing and Development)\n\n1% - Buyback\n\n**How can I buy $ICEBERG?**\n\nYou can buy Iceberg on the Swap, the Cross Chain Swap on the Iceberg Website (link) or on PancakeSwap.[ https:\/\/pancakeswap.finance\/swap](https:\/\/pancakeswap.finance\/swap)\n\n**What is the Total Supply?**\n\nIceberg\u2019s total supply is 100 Million\n\n**What is the Contract address?**\n\nTBA\n\n**What is the recommended Slippage?**\n\nUse slippage between 8% to 10%.\n\nTo use 1% slippage lower the amount of Iceberg and add .01\n\ne.g. 900,000 > 880,000.01\n\n**Is Iceberg SAFU?**\n\nThe Iceberg contract is currently being audited by both Certik and Techrate.The results will be posted shortly.\n\nPoints Highlighted:\n\n\ud83d\udc8eCreated by a Successful Team\n\n\\- $ICEBERG co-founders are Halo & Frank, co-founder and award-winning CEO of BabyCake respectively\n\n\\- BabyCake reached an ATH MarketCap of $112 Million\n\n\\- Winner of 3 awards in Dubai\n\n\\- Smart Contract was forked over 250 times!\n\n\ud83d\udc8eProduct Already Developed\n\n\\- ICEBERG Protocol\u2019s Smart Locker has already been developed and is available.\n\n\\- Our first client has already signed up for the LP Solution!\n\n\\- Rubic Cross-Chain Swap is complete and ready-to-use!\n\n\ud83d\udc8eExperienced Marketing Team & Strategy\n\n\\- Reload \ud83d\udd04 $112 Million MC in other project (The team has gotten wiser!)\n\n\\- Highly Skilled Team has developed an aggressive marketing plan which integrates Influencers, Poocoin, Reddit, Telegram, Twitter and more.\n\n\\- Huge marketing budget will drive massive exposure!\n\n\\- Partnerships with Influencers\n\n\\- Chinese Telegram group\n\n\ud83e\uddcaLP Locked\n\n\ud83e\uddcaCertik and Techrate Audits incoming\n\n\ud83e\uddcaFAIR.

What we\u2019re referencing is a well thought out idea coming together to form a masterpiece. What we are NOT talking about is just another coin! Now that we have your attention we would like to introduce you to *\u2018The coolest way to burn tokens\u2019*\u2026\n\nOn ***December 20th at 4 PM UTC*** the all new hyper-deflationary utility **$ICEBERG Token** will have the biggest fair launch of the year, and in a few brief points, here\u2019s why.\n\n\u2605 ***The ICEBERG Protocol***\n\nIs a cutting edge Auto-Vest-And-Burn system with Smart Locker utility. In other words the *ICEBERG Protocol* takes a percentage of tokens and auto-vests, or locks them away, in a secured digital storage bin called a Smart Locker. From here tokens are then burned on schedule in the future. This means that the **$ICEBERG Token** is built to burn, burn, burn! \ud83d\udd25 \n\n***The ICEBERG Team***\n\nIs made up of the core team from BabyCake. Frank Littiero is an award winning CEO and engaged leader who believes it is important to take time to listen and interact with investors. Together with Strategy Advisor Halo, they formed ICEBERG and appointed other key team members to join in making ICEBERG a huge success! \ud83d\ude4c\n\nICEBERG has several things that are very notable to mention. The team has a *website launching soon* with tokenomics and other important details listed in the ***ICEPAPER***! \ud83d\uddd2\n\n\u2605 ***ICEBERG Cross-Chain Swap***\n\nIs already developed and ready for release! The team has partnered with RUBIC to bring a swap allowing for interoperation between BSC and ETH, SOL, MATIC, AVAX and more! The resourcefulness and experience of the team has created an environment which benefits from existing partnerships and skills that empower them to get things done quickly. It\u2019s no wonder their first project soared to a $112 million dollar market cap in less than a week after launching! \ud83d\udce3\n\n***50% of Total Supply Will Be Burned*** over the first 50 days of being launched! The Auto-Vest-And-Burn Protocol will see 1% of the $ICEBERG total supply burned daily for 50 consecutive days! This is a first of its kind and will cause prices to soar as highly strategic marketing and promotion amplify the organic build-up of this highly anticipated launch!\n\n***3 Burn Mechanisms \ud83d\udc40***\n\nThat\u2019s right! Besides the supply burned from the Smart Locker there will also be *Transaction Burns* conducted constantly on every buy and sell. 1% of each token transaction will go to a ***BuyBack wallet*** which will perform strategic buybacks.\n\nThe third burn mechanism the team is excited to announce are ***Utility Burns!***\n\nRemember that ICEBERG Protocol?! Of course you do! The *ICEBERG Smart Locker* is the *already-developed utility and product* available for client utilization! Fees for use will be burned, rounding out a dynamic and evolved consistently burning token! \ud83d\udcb0\n\nThe **tokenomics** are very comfortable with a 7% buy and 10% sell tax already announced. *Marketing plans* will be released soon and with the team that ICEBERG has assembled we can expect them to be monumental! They are being very intentional and committed to increasing interest through completely organic measures. Anti-bot measures are in place from now through launch, covering all bases from community to contract. The **ICEBERG Telegram and Twitter** accounts have charted consistent increases in followers since being published just days ago.\n\nUnder the leadership of Halo and Frank **ICEBERG Labs** plans to create many huge projects and ideas in the future. For now the team wants to focus on this initial project and make **December 20th** a day to remember in the DeFi space with the biggest fair market launch of 2021! They have a very big idea with this hyper-deflationary, auto-vesting, always-burning $ICEBERG ecosystem being driven by that fresh new ice cold protocol. \ud83d\ude0e\n\n**Audits and listings** will also come very shortly, along with more partnerships and alliances to support the growth and expansion of the ICEBERG name and reach! This contract and project model is a no-brainer and sure to be a huge hit with the majority of investors nowadays seeking systems that work. Given the advanced, efficient ICEBERG Protocol there have been early mentions of comparisons with Safemoon. With the documented success of Frank, Halo and the team it would be safe to say that this launch will be an epic event! \ud83d\udca3\n\nSo there you have it.

This is our first token launch as token owners. We have previously worked on multiple teams assisting with marketing, listings, and community leadership positions, but we are now achieving our aspirations of operating our own business. We have responsibilities in several renowned cryptocurrency groups and decided it was time to unite all of our efforts and create something extraordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Panda Multiverse is first and foremost about its community and our commitment to helping one another, as well as our passion for Pandas!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from that, we are a reward token that pays out 1% BUSD to token holders and 4% BUSD to token holders who also own one of our BSC NFTs (with the ability to bridge the others).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are a cross-chain NFT platform that has an FPS P2E Zombie Panda game that rewards in legendary NFT pieces.

Our game will include branding and marketing as though it were its own metaverse that changes over time. One of our more ambitious aims (you heard it here first) is to have a Panda multi-verse NFT Temple within the TCG metaverse. More specifics coming soon. We can't provide everything at once, and of course, our NFTs are hand-created masterpieces you can only acquire within the Panda multi-verse!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur initial 250 NFTs on BSC sold very quickly, leaving many people wanting more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, as we waited for our deal to be completed, we put an extra 250 on BSC, and they sold out even faster! We sold 550 NFTs in total in the run-up to our token launch, generating additional income for marketing and assisting with liquidity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are actively minting on SOL and searching for extra usefulness for SOL holders to profit from without needing to bridge back to BSC for incentives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to NFT purchases, the Panda Multiverse will generate other revenue streams through our P2E game, in which players may spend in-game money and other projects can pay to advertise in-game (2 already on board). In addition, we will offer a line of personalized clothes and one-of-a-kind shoes to help generate marketing income for the project. In addition, our NFT artists will collaborate with other projects on their NFTs, generating more revenue for the Panda Multiverse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're here to have a good time, trade beautiful art, form strong bonds, support the Pandas, and help one another grow as tall as the tallest bamboo!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"In an infinite multiverse, there is no such thing as fiction.\"** PandaMultiverse\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/discord.gg\/scPzaTTBdV](https:\/\/discord.gg\/scPzaTTBdV)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/panda-multiverse\/](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/panda-multiverse\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[http:\/\/www.pandamultiversenft.com](http:\/\/www.pandamultiversenft.com)","354":"MiniSolana is unlike any other crypto project you have ever been part of.

The immediate plans are to:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Develop further utility for $CCC by building an OHM fork which will give $CCC more exposure to other assets such as ETH, AVAX, stables, etc.\n- Seed\/IDO allocation\n- Deploy on multiple chains (FTM, BSC, ZK-Rollups, SOL, etc)\n- Partnerships\n- wrapped $CCC (for tax purposes and lending)\n- NFTs\n- Metaverse\/P2E\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n######\ud83d\ude80Why $CCC?\n\n- Passive income\n- Exposure to multiple high quality crypto projects\n- Become part of an investor community\n- Early access to new projects\n- Education","359":"Apidai.Network \ud83c\udf0d the Future of Finance..\n\nApidai is not just a Blockchain Platform, it in an decentralized Ecosystem end it is established to serve for the total world population..\n\n30% Supply Burned \ud83d\udd25 10000+ Holders \u2705  CEX listing \u2705 \n\n\u2705Famous influencers \u2705Major Exchange Listing\n\n\u26a1\ufe0f Stake $APIDAI and get $USDT as reward 33% ROI APY \n\n\ud83c\udf1f Featured by Bloomberg Nasdaq & Yahoo.finance \n\n\u2747\ufe0f Listed allready on \n\u2747\ufe0f CoinMarketCap ( https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/apidai\/ )\n\u2747\ufe0f CoinGecko ( https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/apidai-network )\n\u2747\ufe0f Coinbase ( https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/price\/apidai )\n\u2747\ufe0f PancakeSwap ( https:\/\/exchange.pancakeswap.finance\/#\/swap?inputCurrency=0x1dbea177ced3dfaedc37223916ed6d7b05bf3247 )\n\u2747\ufe0f Nomics ( https:\/\/nomics.com\/assets\/apidai-apidai-network\/markets )\n\u2747\ufe0f DexTools ( https:\/\/www.dextools.io\/app\/bsc\/pair-explorer\/0x207a547ac06fbb9912f093f5d4494fef061be391 )\n\nMake your Apidai function as an global currrency with just a single App: \u27a1\ufe0f ApidaiPay ( https:\/\/Apidai.cash )\n\nYou can pay contactless with ApidaiPay through NFC and spend cryptocurrency Globally in everyday transactions, regardless of the merchant.\n\n\u2747\ufe0f Tokenomics\nToken: APIDAI\nMax.

We have responsibilities in several renowned cryptocurrency groups and decided it was time to unite all of our efforts and create something extraordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Panda Multiverse is first and foremost about its community and our commitment to helping one another, as well as our passion for Pandas!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from that, we are a reward token that pays out 1% BUSD to token holders and 4% BUSD to token holders who also own one of our BSC NFTs (with the ability to bridge the others).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are a cross-chain NFT platform that has an FPS P2E Zombie Panda game that rewards in legendary NFT pieces.

One of our more ambitious aims (you heard it here first) is to have a Panda multi-verse NFT Temple within the TCG metaverse. More specifics coming soon. We can't provide everything at once, and of course, our NFTs are hand-created masterpieces you can only acquire within the Panda multi-verse!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur initial 250 NFTs on BSC sold very quickly, leaving many people wanting more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, as we waited for our deal to be completed, we put an extra 250 on BSC, and they sold out even faster! We sold 550 NFTs in total in the run-up to our token launch, generating additional income for marketing and assisting with liquidity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are actively minting on SOL and searching for extra usefulness for SOL holders to profit from without needing to bridge back to BSC for incentives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to NFT purchases, the Panda Multiverse will generate other revenue streams through our P2E game, in which players may spend in-game money and other projects can pay to advertise in-game (2 already on board). In addition, we will offer a line of personalized clothes and one-of-a-kind shoes to help generate marketing income for the project.

This is our first token launch as token owners. We have previously worked on multiple teams assisting with marketing, listings, and community leadership positions, but we are now achieving our aspirations of operating our own business. We have responsibilities in several renowned cryptocurrency groups and decided it was time to unite all of our efforts and create something extraordinary.\n\nThe Panda Multiverse is first and foremost about its community and our commitment to helping one another, as well as our passion for Pandas!\n\nAside from that, we are a reward token that pays out 1% BUSD to token holders and 4% BUSD to token holders who also own one of our BSC NFTs (with the ability to bridge the others).\n\nWe are a cross-chain NFT platform that has an FPS P2E Zombie Panda game that rewards in legendary NFT pieces. We're also collaborating with other tokens to create their NFTs, giving further income and publicity back to the Panda multiverse. \n\nTokenomics\n\n2% LP\n\n6% MARKETING\n\nHolders of 4% NFT in BUSD\n\n2% NFT HOLDERS' WEEKLY PAYDAY\n\n1% DEV\n\nWe have announced a new collaboration with FarmerDoge!\n\nWe'll be performing their next NFTs alongside the great musician himself!\n\nIn addition, FarmerDoge will be cultivating Panda Multi-verse in the near future, which will bring us massive volume and new holders only from this collaboration!\n\nWe've also recently announced that each new investor who purchases a $50 minimum will receive a complimentary limited edition 8bit Panda NFT!\n\nWhere else can you buy a tiny quantity of tokens and receive an NFT as a welcome gift?\n\nPanda Multiverse is continually rewarding its fans with gifts and games based on our own Telegram and Discord communities!\n\nOur cross-chain NFT sales and ability to bridge them help us separate from other typical initiatives. And our FPS P2E Zombie Pandas game is on a completely different level of professionalism; it is nothing short of spectacular! This is a must-play for both gamers and crypto aficionados! Our game will include branding and marketing as though it were its own metaverse that changes over time. One of our more ambitious aims (you heard it here first) is to have a Panda multi-verse NFT Temple within the TCG metaverse. More specifics coming soon. We can't provide everything at once, and of course, our NFTs are hand-created masterpieces you can only acquire within the Panda multi-verse! \n\nOur initial 250 NFTs on BSC sold very quickly, leaving many people wanting more.\n\nSo, as we waited for our deal to be completed, we put an extra 250 on BSC, and they sold out even faster! We sold 550 NFTs in total in the run-up to our token launch, generating additional income for marketing and assisting with liquidity. \n\nWe are actively minting on SOL and searching for extra usefulness for SOL holders to profit from without needing to bridge back to BSC for incentives.\n\nIn addition to NFT purchases, the Panda Multiverse will generate other revenue streams through our P2E game, in which players may spend in-game money and other projects can pay to advertise in-game (2 already on board). In addition, we will offer a line of personalized clothes and one-of-a-kind shoes to help generate marketing income for the project. In addition, our NFT artists will collaborate with other projects on their NFTs, generating more revenue for the Panda Multiverse.\n\nWe're here to have a good time, trade beautiful art, form strong bonds, support the Pandas, and help one another grow as tall as the tallest bamboo! \n\n\"In an infinite multiverse, there is no such thing as fiction.\" PandaMultiverse\n\n   \n \n\n[http:\/\/t.me\/PandaMultiverse](http:\/\/t.me\/PandaMultiverse)\n\n[https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/panda-multiverse\/](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/panda-multiverse\/)\n\n[http:\/\/www.pandamultiversenft.com](http:\/\/www.pandamultiversenft.com\/)","368":"\ud83d\udcb5**Received grants funding from NEAR, advisor from DuckDAO, Blockchain APE (partner Long Hash).They own an innovative product, a comprehensive dashboard that is an indispensable bridge to the DeFi world. \ud83c\udf09** DePocket allows you to spend less time switching between tabs and apps by centralizing all of your needs comprehensively.

And every time it feels like they say TOO THE MOON! The idea is always TOO THE MOON!\n\nI'm tired of people asking \"why\" when there are no answers or visions provided to justify their project, even if they come from investors like me who have reached out before in hopes that we'll work together one day but haven't gotten much response yet (not surprising).\n\nNow here comes Embr.. A project that didnt make outlandish promises. In fact they undersold themselves. Immediately I was intrigued.

BE A SKEPTIC!\u00a0\n\nI did extensive research about their contracts. I saw the hesitancy people had about buying presale because of the vesting and if it really worked. Now i see the praises of how well it was executed. How easy it was to buy in and now retrieve their tokens after the fact. And most importantly.. Why they built these products in an attempt to mitigate all the nonsense that I see the community I care so much about brings up on a consistent basis!\n\nThen comes the big drop.. Their partnership with Wyre! They just partnered with Avalanche and Sol (Also did anyone else notice the tokenomics that SOL and EMBR has, that there is a lot of similarity??) !!

The rationale for KKO\u2019s value-add is obvious \u2013 global governments are increasingly imposing stricter regulations on online casino operators, directly interfering with the user experience by creating complex rules and restrictions. The future of online gambling is likely one that is decentralized and crypto-based.\n\nWhat is the incentive for users to use the Kineko platform?\n\n1. People that bet using the native $KKO token receive 2% cash back for all bets.\n\n2. KKO sets aside monthly coin emissions to reward users betting on their platform, equal to their pro rata portion of betting volume.\n\nSince launching in June 2021, Kineko\u2019s website has already amassed 5,000+ active daily users. Total betting volume in October was $6.76m ($3.6mm from casino, $3.1mm from sportsbook). In their first four months, Kineko has generated $514,400 of profit, of which 50% has been used to burn overall token supply. Annualizing October\u2019s financials, they are generating $81.1mm of gambling volumes, and $1.54mm of profit. That compares to current market cap of \\~$10mm (6.8x cash flow).\n\nKKO\u2019s success comes despite minimal marketing effort to date \u2013 strictly word-of-mouth has led to $81m of volume and $1.5m of profit. The company intends to market more following its migration to Solana (see below), which should help drive incremental demand.\n\nWithin the next 3 months, there should be three big catalysts:\n\n1. Migration to Solana \u2013 **complete!** By migrating, users save on Ethereum fees, which have skyrocketed and are cost prohibitive for what is an extremely long-tail of low volume gamblers and potential investors.\n\n2. Marketing! Post migration, Kineko will launch an affiliate marketing program. More users will lead to higher betting volumes, which will generate higher revenues and profit, as well as incremental demand for the coin.\n\n3. Getting added to a CEX (Centralized Exchange). One of the main drawbacks today is the difficulty in buying $KKO. It is not a simple process for less mainstream crypto investors. Kineko hopes to get added to an exchange, such as FTX, in 4Q21 or 1Q22. This will simplify the process for users to buy Kineko, in addition to the fact that exchanges will have to acquire large sums of KKO prior to listing it.\n\nValuation is a moving target, given how fast the business is growing. What I can say is that I believe it is incredibly undervalued. Looking at just DraftKings as a comp \u2013 DraftKings generated $1bn of LTM revenues, and trades at a 16x revenue multiple\u2026 and they lose money.\n\nI\u2019m not going to argue Kineko should be worth more than DraftKings. But it does generate \\~8% of DraftKings revenues and is profitable. A large crypto-exposed gambling business, that is actually generating a profit, should be worth a lot more than where it is today. Current market cap is $10mm, which is 0.12x revenue, 6.8x cash flow, and is just .06% of DraftKing\u2019s market cap. Here\u2019s some sensitivities on what valuation could be, based on annualized revenues:\n\n\\- 16x revenue multiple = $1.3bn valuation (125x return)\n\n\\- 10x revenue multiple = $800m valuation (77x return)\n\n\\- 5x revenue multiple = $400m valuation (39x return)\n\nThis should explode in Q4 and beyond. Enough screaming at the screen, here are the few steps you need to follow to buy the coin:\n\n1. Buy Solana\n\n2. Create a Phantom wallet, and send the Solana to your Phantom wallet address\n\n3. Go to Raydium.io\/swap and connect your wallet\n\n4. Swap Solana for Kineko. For the next day or so, you may have to import Kineko as a token onto Raydium.

You can than choose the amount of $SOLV you want to buy (payment in SOL, so make sure you have also enough SOL in your wallet) \n\nAfter IDO is completed and listed on Raydium, you can claim your tokens. Our pair on Raydium will be SOLV\/USDC. \n\nThe first IDO of Solcubator will be based on guaranteed allocation. No staking needed to participate in the upcoming IDO. Just hold SOLC in your wallet. Solcubator will announce 24h before IDO more details about minimum and maximum allocation per tier. \n\nInitial Marketcap  : 457K\n\nIDO 16th NOV 1:00 PM UTC on Solcubator.io Launchpad! \n\n**IMPORTANT LINKS**\n\nWebsite: [https:\/\/solview.app](https:\/\/solview.app\/)\n\nTwitter: [https:\/\/twitter.com\/Solviewapp](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Solviewapp)\n\nMedium: [https:\/\/medium.com\/@solview](https:\/\/medium.com\/@solview)\n\nTelegram official community: [https:\/\/t.me\/solviewofficial](https:\/\/t.me\/solviewofficial)","388":"\u26a1\ufe0fApidai.Network - Presale is Live\u26a1\ufe0f \n\nApidai.Network is not just a Blockchain Platform, it in an decentralized Ecosystem end it is established to serve for the total world population. \n\n\ud83c\udf1fApidai.Network \u2014 Roadmap v1.0\ud83c\udf1f\n\nApidaiFinance \u2014 Decentralized Finance Q4 2021  \nApidaiPay \u2014 Global Payments Q4 2021  \nApidaiNFT \u2014 Apidai NFT Marketplace Q4 2021  \nApidaiChain \u2014 Apidai Chain Q1 2022  \nApidaiVerse \u2014 Apidai Metaverse Q1 2022  \n\n\n\u2022 Store Crypto and get Rewarded \n\nStore & Stake your cryptocurrencies with ApidaiPay and earn rewards on assets such as APIDAI, BNB, ETH, SOL, AVAX and more.. \n\n\u2022 Buy & Sell Crypto \n\nPurchase cryptocurrencies with FIAT using Apple Pay, debit and credit cards, bank transfers and other methods of payment. \n\n\u2022 Pay Contactless with your Phone or Watch \n\nYou can pay contactless with ApidaiPay through NFC and spend cryptocurrency in everyday transactions, regardless of the merchant. \n\n\u27a1\ufe0fApidai Metaverse v1.0 \n\nApidai Metaverse building a virtual world: Hanging gardens of babylon.  \nAverse is a New type of a game totally owned and operated by its players\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Apidai.Network \ud83c\udf10 Be your own Bank \ud83c\udf10   \n\u2705 Benefits for early adopters \u2705  \n\u23f0For early adaptors 30% bonus\u23f0   \n\u26a1\ufe0fEarly access on our products.  \n\u26a1\ufe0fGet up to 40% ROI APY for staking.   \n\u26a1\ufe0fa lot of free NFTS Airdrop and more \n\nMaximum Supply: 10.000.000.000\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f [Participate NOW \u2b05\ufe0f](https:\/\/sale.apidai.network\/)\n\nJoin Telegram   \n[Group](https:\/\/t.me\/apidaiofficial)  \n[Channel](https:\/\/t.me\/apidainetwork)  \n[Reddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apidaiofficial\/)  \n[Medium](https:\/\/medium.com\/@apidainetwork)","389":"$SOLANUP is a community driven project based on the Binance Smart Chain with a real use case.

A bunch of highly intelligent, connected, successful people are aligning themselves with Jon Manzi and the rest of this team\u200a\u2014\u200aI imagine they\u2019re doing so for good reason.\n\nSpeaking of Jon\u2026 this dude is 27, was a big deal at Stanford before he left to found his company, and made his first million at age 16. I dug up this article about him, looks like one of those maniacal perfectionist high achievers lol.

These are the bets you want to make.\n\nA couple of things to be aware of short term:\n\n* mainnet launches in Q2 of 2022, so there will be an eventual token swap from ERC20 to native token\n* a small group of early investors (I hear around 100 people) got in between $0.20 and $1, but they\u2019re all vested for 1\u20135 years\u2026 and recently voted in favor of deferred receipt of tokens in exchange for bonus payments in 2022 (if they wanted to take significant profits they\u2019d have wanted them asap, BP is trading at $30 right now after over a month on the market)\n\n  \nUltimately, I consider this a big upside long term bet. I\u2019d look to accumulate a nice chunk before mainnet, then just forget about it for a while\u2026 projects with strong fundamentals tend to do really well once the tech actually launches. Again, think Solana, Cardano, etc. Heck, even the run-up in anticipation of launch can be explosive (Vectorspace AI recently).\n\n  \nDon\u2019t let this be one of those projects you heard about and never acted on, then see it way up in a few months. Consider this your early heads up.  **\ud83d\udcc8**","397":"Galaxy Heroes Coin\n\nStarting only a few short weeks ago Galaxy Heroes Coin is steaming ahead of all competition in the market and smashing the roadmap at lightning speed!

Our aims are to bring the community much smoother experiences and future applications to the cryptocurrency market SPIKE\u2019s mission is to bring cryptocurrency concepts in which the trend of development is always towards the newest things.\n\nSPIKE INU will bring into the crypto world the newest generation apps such as Defi, NFT Market Place Metaverse, CrossChain Swap, Decentralized Exchange, Multichain Wallet, and charitable purposes.\n\n**ECOSYSTEM**\n\n1. SPIKE Token\n\nAn ERC20 meme token that fosters and promotes healthy and widespread usage and decentralization of the project through a specific reward linked to users\u2019 transactions involving decentralized wallets.\n\n2. SPIKE CROSSCHAIN SWAP\n\nSPIKE SWAP is a cross-chain trading platform deployed on many public chains (currently supports SOL, NEAR , BSC, ETH, OEC and POLYGON), with security, low transaction fees, fast speed. And this is for the first time, cross-chain transaction time is shortened to the level of seconds, which is an important milestone in the blockchain industry.\n\nMoney should never sleep but rather always flows efficiently. SPIKE's founding team entered the DeFi space in mid-2021 seeing how complicated and inefficient cross-chain transactions were. As the result, our team came up with the idea to build SPIKE SWAP with the goal of shortening cross-chain transaction time. Our team have successfully built the new network that allows cross-chain transaction times to be shortened to seconds! This is a major milestone and another major infrastructure improvement in the DeFi industry.\n\n3. SPIKE NFT Marketplace\n\nAt SPIKE NFT Marketplace, we're excited about a brand-new type of digital good called a non-fungible token, or NFT. NFTs have exciting new properties: they\u2019re unique, provably scarce, tradeable, and usable across multiple applications. Just like physical goods, you can do whatever you want with them! You could throw them in the trash, gift them to a friend across the world, or go sell them on an open marketplace. But unlike physical goods, they're armed with all the programmability of digital assets.\n\nThese goods can be different in nature, but the only rule is applicable that they are 100% digital and tokenized. You will get 100% ownership once you pay for them, as the transactions and proof of ownership are stored forever on the blockchain. These include collectibles, game items, and many other types of digital goods. The assets are live on the blockchain and are their property so that you can access them at any time\n\nA core part of our vision is that open protocols like Ethereum and interoperable standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155 will enable vibrant new economies. We're building tools that allow consumers to trade their assets freely, creators to launch new digital works, and developers to build rich, integrated marketplaces for their digital assets. We are proud to be the next market for NFT\n\n4. SPIKE DEX\n\nSPIKE DEX is a unique combination of centralized and decentralized architecture that together create a superior user experience for both casual and advanced users.\n\nSPIKE DEX will built on many different platforms ( BSC, ERC20, SOL, POLYGON, NEAR, FANTOM.) . You will be able to freely trade all coins, tokens without having to use other Dex.\n\nWe are also delightful to announce that a decentralized margin system 20X will be built for all Platforms. Not only that, our Automated Market Maker (AMM) Protocols will also be utilised which give the user more freedom when trading.\n\n5. SPIKE WALLET\n\nSPIKE WALLET is a decentralized cryptocurrency storage wallet, has multiple layers of security built in as well as an intuitive user interface, allowing users to store, send, swap, buy and trade their coins efficiently and securely.\n\nSPIKE WALLET will support wide range of coins and tokens. Our Multi-coin wallet application will support Ethereum ecosystem blockchains, working roughly with ERC20, ERC721, ERC223, BEP20, TOMO, SOL, TRC20 tokens.\n\nSimple Payment: The payment is optimally simplified for users. Transferring coins is as easy as sending a message to anyone in any location on earth.\n\nHigh Security: Take full control of your assets with Biometric Security and Private Key \u2013 managed by yourself, none of your personal data is collected by the app.\n\nMulti-asset management: Spike Wallet fully supports popular blockchains\n\nInstant Exchange: Exchange many coins directly without transferring coins to the exchange\n\nDApp Integration: You can quickly access various DApps with just Spike Wallet\n\nwebsite: [https:\/\/spikeinu.io\/](https:\/\/spikeinu.io\/)\n\ntelegram: [https:\/\/t.me\/SpikeInuGlobal](https:\/\/t.me\/SpikeInuGlobal)\n\nWhitepaper: [https:\/\/github.com\/Spikeinu\/Whitepaper\/blob\/main\/White-paper-Spikeinu.pdf](https:\/\/github.com\/Spikeinu\/Whitepaper\/blob\/main\/White-paper-Spikeinu.pdf)\n\nAudit: [https:\/\/github.com\/Spikeinu\/Audit\/blob\/main\/SPIKE%20INU%20Full%20Smart%20Contract%20Security%20Audit.pdf](https:\/\/github.com\/Spikeinu\/Audit\/blob\/main\/SPIKE%20INU%20Full%20Smart%20Contract%20Security%20Audit.pdf)\n\nCoingecko: [https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/spike-inu](https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/spike-inu)\n\nCoinmarketcap: [https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/spike-inu\/](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/spike-inu\/)","400":"\ud83d\udc49 Telegram -\u00a0 [https:\/\/t.me\/vlad\\_vs\\_volod](https:\/\/t.me\/vlad_vs_volod)\n\nAs you all know Russia started its full military operations in Ukraine.

Each nft has different stats (hp, defense, attack, energy, dodge, and critical hit) which are fueled by their attributes.\n\nThe objective is to fight against other players in a \"Battle royal\" mode to win the fights.\n\nThe  clashes are in 1v1 (for the moment) turn-based and the winner gets a  reward in SOL from a wallet which is fed with 80% of the royalties and  also a part of the profits.\n\n**This game mode is free, and each nft can fight every 12 hours.**\n\nAnother  game mode will arrive after the project is released. The \"Match making\"  mode, the fights will be identical to those of the \"Battle royal\" mode  with a little subtlety.\n\nTo fight  you will have to bet an amount in SOL (0.1) and your opponent will have  to do the same.

All $BBY is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. USDC) that produces an intrinsic value it cannot fall below\"\n\nIf you are familiar with **Olympus Dao** (eth) or **Wonderland Time**(avax) then this a solana version of that project. It is NOT a fork since Solana is not erc20 compatible. \n\n\nBecause of this, there are very few DAOs offered on Solana since these project creators cant just copy\/paste code from OHM. As far as I know there is only 1other project currently active on Solana, Invictus. That project has done alright but rushed out of development to claim the first title. \n\n\nBabylon Dao has had more time to develop to avoid initial deployment problems but more importantly, their discord member count is over **double** (16k +) of Invictus and they haven't even launched. \n\nThe most unique aspect to this DAO is the community aspect and the theme of ancient Babylon. All members in the discord are assigned a role relating to Babylonian titles and lore. In order to increase your role to something higher you must learn of old Babylon history or be a scribe and spread the word of Babylon Dao\n\nIt might be too late to get a whitelist spot but if you can get in early you can expect big gains as the treasury grows. I would advise getting in this as early as possible to reap any benefits.","413":"MiniSolana is unlike any other crypto project you have ever been part of.

There's tons of stuff happening in the space: 1) 500M coin burn on a random day each month for the next 6 months, 2) SAMO NFTs to be released with buy-back and burn mechanism built in, 3) Metaverse projects coming soon, 4) A super motivated and efficient dev team who were heavily involved in Solana's recent Ignition Hackathon.\n\nThe community's super friendly and welcoming at the moment, so post in the r\/SamoyedCoin subreddit if you have any questions \u2665\ufe0f\n\nI strongly believe that (however you feel about meme\/dog coins) the hype from SAMO could be a fun yet powerful advertisement for the Solana blockchain - which as we all know is the fastest blockchain existing right now.

If it can do this for me, who was already a SOL advocate, then it can definitely do this for millions more users.\n\nAs the fastest and cheapest to transact dogcoin existing right now, this should be all the info you need to make the call.

DxSale\u2019s goal is unlike other launchpads in that they are not a curated launchpad (no vetting of tokens being launched) and do not require the developers launching the project, or buyers of potential projects to hold $SALE to participate. On it\u2019s face this appears as a negative as it doesn\u2019t incentivize holding the token. However it aligns with their goal, to be a decentralized launchpad where anyone can participate and prospective investors are responsible for doing their own research. In addition to their launchpad they currently also have DxLocker which is a product used to lock tokens either for set period of time or according to a vesting schedule which gives investors the assurances and visibility of when developers can sell their tokens or deplete the liquidity pool. In addition, they have plans for additional products with DxSwap, DxNFT, and DxFarm to come in Q4. With the rollout of V3 which started August 26th In short, DxSale\u2019s goal of being a truly decentralized platform for any blockchain in accordance with the principles of DeFi and cryptocurrency as a whole.\n \nCurrently they have the following networks available on their platform available for IDOs and available to utilize DxLocker.\n \n* Ethereum \u2013 Added Feb 24th\n\n* Binance Smart Chain \u2013 Added Feb 24th\n\n* Matic\/Polygon \u2013 Added March 9th\n\n* Avalanche \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* Fantom \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* Harmony \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* xDai \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* OKEx \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* KCC - Added mid July\n\n* Cardano - Coming Soon with V3.5\n\n* Solana - Coming Soon with V3.5\n \n**Launches**\n \nThere are two parts of the launchpad standard token launch or DeFi launches. Standard token launches are pre-defined contracts where DxSale retains ownership of the contract and compared to the DeFi launchpad are relatively safe. The majority of token launches however are taking place on the DeFi launchpad. This is where anyone can launch their DeFi project and where we have seen projects like SafeMoon etc. launch. Yes reddits favorite coin was the 8th project to launch on DxSale. This platform has exploded they have had over 15,000 projects attempted launch with about 3,500 meeting minimum funds raised needed to finalize. This is where things get interesting from a revenue prospective. \n\n **DxSale's cut:**\n\n- DxSale takes a cut of every presale with a fee to list (1 BNB) and they take a portion of every presale launch\u2019s revenue (2%), and a portion of the projects tokens (2%). \n \n**Revenue Streams:**\n\n- DxSale\u2019s cut from presales is listed above however they have other revenue streams as well. DxMint which is a tool that makes it easy to create an approved contract from DxSale with adjustable tax amounts (1BNB). Token Locker (.1 BNB per lock) and a Whitelist function (1 BNB). In addition there are more revenue streams coming. Penalty withdraw will allow users who buy into a presale to withdraw their funds before the token launches with a penalty fee if after investing and not doing their research they realize the project is a scam. With v3 a few new revenue streams were introduced. Emergency withdraw allows people to withdraw their funds after investing in a presale with a 20% penalty going to the revenue pool. In addition DxFairLaunch and DxDrop are also two new dApps which will bring additional revenue. \n\n\n**\u201cWhat all these shitcoins I\u2019ve been hearing about are coming from here?! How have I not heard of this? And they have a token?\u201d**\n\n- Yes! Why haven\u2019t you heard of it? Because we have the most Sigma dev\u2019s on the planet. These guys from a coding perspective are all stars. No other platforms have as many chains, no other platform is this successful. However, they have not even begun to market. Instead, they have building, ensuring everything is in place. Due to revenue, they now have more than enough to maintain salaries for their team through any bear market. They have fixed small issues that have caused support requests taking up their time. Now however with V3 launching they are beginning to market the project to bring in more developers on the platform and more revenue for buy and burn. \n\n\n**This is where the fun begins Tokenomics and revenue.** \n\n- So why did I go into this looong explanation about what DxSale is and their revenue? Because it all plays into the Tokenomics and why I haven\u2019t sold a single $SALE and only accumulated. I have been doing this the entire bull run, felt like that meme with Squiward looking out the window at Patrick and SpongeBob having fun with their 10-100xs while I held SALE. SALE however is a sure thing, it was guaranteed to go up why? Because of Buy and Burn Tokenomics. DxSale has gone through a few iterations of their token model before buy and burn there was a clunky staking mechanism where we were airdropped more SALE tokens. The Devs however then came up with this buy and burn model and got rid of staking. This cut out the middleman causing two effects, one the initial buy of the token increases the price, two the token is then burned further reducing the supply. The net effect for token holders was same as staking but much simpler to implement and doesn\u2019t require you to stake. [Lets look at the chart as of today.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/GcK53YC) As you can see all bull run SALE has been crabbing between a low of .10 and brief highs near .40-.50. However SALE has been on a tear recently thanks to[ buy and burn](https:\/\/imgur.com\/GcK53YC). The volume for this coin is stupid low because we have had almost no new buyers due to no marketing or shilling. Almost all gains have been from the devs buying and burning the token. I outlined the revenue streams, the revenue is distributed as 50% for the devs and 50% for buy and burn.\n \n\n**Now lets take a look at revenue (these graphs were put together by members of the community from analysis tool)**\n\n[Total amount of projects that have successfully raised funds and launched \\(2% of Raised funds and 2% of project tokens split between devs and buy and burn\\)](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LcsN2Ey)\n \n- 3,500\n\n[Total amount of projects that have attempted launch \\(1 BNB Fee each\\)](https:\/\/imgur.com\/K4vZXaB)\n\n- 10,000\n\n[Monthly Revenue](https:\/\/imgur.com\/5gZPfDj)\n\n\n[Amount of money left for buy and burn from fees](https:\/\/imgur.com\/MRqcrAk) 1,297,006\n\n[Amount of project tokens remaining to be sold for buy and burn](https:\/\/imgur.com\/Laemfsz) 2,800,000\n\n\n(Actual dollar amounts higher, taken snapshot before this past days price rise)\n\n\n\n**In conclusion**\n\nAs I and the community have observed the platform just keeps increasing in popularity even through the mini bear market we just had. I have been seeing these numbers all along and that\u2019s why I decided instead of trying to swing trade other projects to just hold SALE for now. Before buy and burn SALE was trading at NEGATIVE 4x earnings annualized\u2026 which is ridiculous.  With the amount of revenue for buy and burn sitting in the current wallets spending it all now would push SALE over 5.00. Now consider that weekly revenue has been outpacing weekly buy and burns. \n\n\nTherefore I am very comfy holding my SALE based on analyzing the Tokenomics, tracking the projects progress, chatting with the devs, and building relationships in the community of whom I consider friends. Am I saying you should buy SALE? NO, I\u2019m saying I really don\u2019t give a shit if you buy SALE hell no one else has to buy SALE the revenue will keep the token price increases and the community of SALErs and I cruise to the moon.","419":"I've been invested in Fantasy World Gold (the in-game currency of Fantasy World Game) since it's launch at the end of November.

This is our first token launch as token owners. We have previously worked on multiple teams assisting with marketing, listings, and community leadership positions, but we are now achieving our aspirations of operating our own business. We have responsibilities in several renowned cryptocurrency groups and decided it was time to unite all of our efforts and create something extraordinary.\n\nThe Panda Multiverse is first and foremost about its community and our commitment to helping one another, as well as our passion for Pandas!\n\nAside from that, we are a reward token that pays out 1% BUSD to token holders and 4% BUSD to token holders who also own one of our BSC NFTs (with the ability to bridge the others).\n\nWe are a cross-chain NFT platform that has an FPS P2E Zombie Panda game that rewards in legendary NFT pieces. We're also collaborating with other tokens to create their NFTs, giving further income and publicity back to the Panda multiverse. \n\nTokenomics\n\n2% LP\n\n6% MARKETING\n\nHolders of 4% NFT in BUSD\n\n2% NFT HOLDERS' WEEKLY PAYDAY\n\n1% DEV\n\nWe have announced a new collaboration with FarmerDoge!\n\nWe'll be performing their next NFTs alongside the great musician himself!\n\nIn addition, FarmerDoge will be cultivating Panda Multi-verse in the near future, which will bring us massive volume and new holders only from this collaboration!\n\nWe've also recently announced that each new investor who purchases a $50 minimum will receive a complimentary limited edition 8bit Panda NFT!\n\nWhere else can you buy a tiny quantity of tokens and receive an NFT as a welcome gift?\n\nPanda Multiverse is continually rewarding its fans with gifts and games based on our own Telegram and Discord communities!\n\nOur cross-chain NFT sales and ability to bridge them help us separate from other typical initiatives. And our FPS P2E Zombie Pandas game is on a completely different level of professionalism; it is nothing short of spectacular! This is a must-play for both gamers and crypto aficionados! Our game will include branding and marketing as though it were its own metaverse that changes over time. One of our more ambitious aims (you heard it here first) is to have a Panda multi-verse NFT Temple within the TCG metaverse. More specifics coming soon. We can't provide everything at once, and of course, our NFTs are hand-created masterpieces you can only acquire within the Panda multi-verse! \n\nOur initial 250 NFTs on BSC sold very quickly, leaving many people wanting more.\n\nSo, as we waited for our deal to be completed, we put an extra 250 on BSC, and they sold out even faster!

CertiK has conducted audit reports for $SSD, and the report confirms that it has passed the audit requirements with over a 98% rating.\n\nMalicious hackers have plagued the blockchain space and stifled the growth of many promising projects. By conducting Formal Verification audits on projects like Secretworld, CertiK aims to guard against some of the most frequent and critical vulnerabilities that have been the source of these attacks.

It also allows users who don\u2019t usually deal in Solana to have an easier access to this new field and vice versa. Therefore, this is a win win for each network. \n\n**What is Solana ?**\n\nTaken from the [Medium](https:\/\/tradestrike.medium.com\/solana-integration-with-the-strikex-wallet-efe381bcbbdb) \u201cLaunched in April 2019, Solana is a highly scalable & robust blockchain capable of up to 65,000 transactions per second. SOL has seen a price surge of nearly 7,000% & a daily volume increase of 8,300% over the last 12 months. It is quickly gaining notoriety for its lightning fast transaction speeds, low gas fees & avid supporters.\u201d \n\nSolana is also a competitor to Ethereum with their low gas fees and quick transactions. They also have many NFT\u2019s that are having a run in the market currently. \n\n**StrikeX Wallet**\n\nDue to launch in Q1\/2 of this year this DeFi Wallet is ready to take the market by storm. Offering features such as **fiat Deposits & Withdrawals,** Portfolio Performance Tracking and Charting, Integrated Dex and much more. \n\nFor more information on the StrikeX Wallet please refer to [my previous DD.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoMoonShots\/comments\/qskxkd\/tradestrike_ltd_dd_strikex_wallet\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is a great announcement by the StrikeX team and shows us all the potential of the project. The team are willing to integrate other networks to maximise their reach and vision. \n\nThis DeFi Wallet has the potential to be the best in the whole of the DeFi space.

This is our first token launch as token owners. We have previously worked on multiple teams assisting with marketing, listings, and community leadership positions, but we are now achieving our aspirations of operating our own business. We have responsibilities in several renowned cryptocurrency groups and decided it was time to unite all of our efforts and create something extraordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Panda Multiverse is first and foremost about its community and our commitment to helping one another, as well as our passion for Pandas!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from that, we are a reward token that pays out 1% BUSD to token holders and 4% BUSD to token holders who also own one of our BSC NFTs (with the ability to bridge the others).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are a cross-chain NFT platform that has an FPS P2E Zombie Panda game that rewards in legendary NFT pieces. We're also collaborating with other tokens to create their NFTs, giving further income and publicity back to the Panda multiverse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n2% LP\n\n6% MARKETING\n\nHolders of 4% NFT in BUSD\n\n2% NFT HOLDERS' WEEKLY PAYDAY\n\n1% DEV\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**We have announced a new collaboration with FarmerDoge!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**We'll be creating their NFTs!**\n\nIn addition, FarmerDoge will be cultivating Panda Multi-verse in the near future, which will bring us massive volume and new holders only from this collaboration!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've also recently announced that each new investor who purchases a $50 minimum will receive a complimentary limited edition 8bit Panda NFT!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where else can you buy a tiny quantity of tokens and receive an NFT as a welcome gift?**\n\nPanda Multiverse is continually rewarding its fans with gifts and games based on our own Telegram and Discord communities!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur cross-chain NFT sales and ability to bridge them help us separate from other typical initiatives. And our FPS P2E Zombie Pandas game is on a completely different level of professionalism; it is nothing short of spectacular! This is a must-play for both gamers and crypto aficionados! Our game will include branding and marketing as though it were its own metaverse that changes over time. One of our more ambitious aims (you heard it here first) is to have a Panda multi-verse NFT Temple within the TCG metaverse. More specifics coming soon. We can't provide everything at once, and of course, our NFTs are hand-created masterpieces you can only acquire within the Panda multi-verse!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur initial 250 NFTs on BSC sold very quickly, leaving many people wanting more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, as we waited for our deal to be completed, we put an extra 250 on BSC, and they sold out even faster! We sold 550 NFTs in total in the run-up to our token launch, generating additional income for marketing and assisting with liquidity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are actively minting on SOL and searching for extra usefulness for SOL holders to profit from without needing to bridge back to BSC for incentives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to NFT purchases, the Panda Multiverse will generate other revenue streams through our P2E game, in which players may spend in-game money and other projects can pay to advertise in-game (2 already on board). In addition, we will offer a line of personalized clothes and one-of-a-kind shoes to help generate marketing income for the project. In addition, our NFT artists will collaborate with other projects on their NFTs, generating more revenue for the Panda Multiverse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're here to have a good time, trade beautiful art, form strong bonds, support the Pandas, and help one another grow as tall as the tallest bamboo!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"In an infinite multiverse, there is no such thing as fiction.\"** PandaMultiverse\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[http:\/\/t.me\/PandaMultiverse](http:\/\/t.me\/PandaMultiverse)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/panda-multiverse\/](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/panda-multiverse\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[http:\/\/www.pandamultiversenft.com](http:\/\/www.pandamultiversenft.com)","467":" **SOLIUM RISE ($SOLAR)** First charity token for POVERTY ALLEVIATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,   \n that also rewards its diamond hand holders with 7% in SOL rewards!.SOLARDEX WITH SOLARSWAP is   \n also in development With detailed wallet portfolio tracking, price notifications and so much more. \n\n If you missed a gem in the past this is your opportunity to get in early.

Our goal was to create something that is simple but yet attractive. Then we thought why not something that cheers everyone up : Goodmorning!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimple but yet effective! Something we all need to hear after we wake up, some of us more than others. Even though the world is a scary and dark place, we strive to be the ray of sunshine that cheers everyone up and gives everyone hope that we can do better and make a real Good Morning out of our day. Since GM wagmi has been released, it has got a marketcap of 400 million! Such a great achievement with something so simple. This was proof that we can make everything work with such simplicity and kindness for each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are one of the first tokens on the Solana Chain. Everyone has seen how well GM Wagmi performed on ETH, now let's show everyone that we can do even better on Solana!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGM SOL token advantages over ETH :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Gas fees almost ZERO\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Sol transaction 0.8 SEC \/ ETH 4MIN\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- GM SOL MC 60K \/ GM ETH 400M MC\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken details and features :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken name : GM solana\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken symbol : $GMsolana\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal supply : 1.000.000.000.000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCirculating supply : 800.000.000.000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLiquidity Locked \ud83d\udee1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCommunity managed utility\n\n&#x200B;\n\n63k MC \ud83d\udca5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust launched!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe GM token on the Solana ecosystem. We are all human degenerates, no matter what jpegs or coins we ape into, we all wake up and say \"good morning\". Saying good morning is more than just two words, it has become one of the strongest world wide movements in existence. It is our goal for GM Solana to put the love and positivity of the Solana community (and others) on the map. Utility and use of GM solana will be decided by the community with votes. So will everything else about this token. As far as funding goes, me and the other developper have been paying everything out of our own pockets and will continue to do so!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main problem with Ethereum based tokens is the gas fees. We all know how irritating it is to lose money for such a simple task, this is why the GM concept will perform much better on the Solana chain. Since there are almost no gas fees (0.0009$), many more people will be able to make transactions. The second problem we saw was that the transaction speed was too slow for even such a huge network. And again, this is why it will work much smoother on Solana since the transaction speed is less than a second!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoin us in our movement, wagmi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite : [https:\/\/www.gmsol.io\/](https:\/\/www.gmsol.io\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTelegram : [https:\/\/t.me\/gmsol\\_io](https:\/\/t.me\/gmsol_io)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiscord : [https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/HhpBEAfDZn](https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/HhpBEAfDZn)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwitter : [https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmsol\\_io](https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmsol_io)","469":"You may be thinking, \u201chow could Solana, with a market-cap of 3.7 Billion, be on a r\/CryptoMoonShots!?\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t burn your eyes staring at the $SOL! \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\udeab \ud83d\udc40\n\nLook at where it shines! \n\ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\udc49 $SRM $RAY $FIDA $SECO $HOLY $KIN $AUDIO $GRT $AKT\ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udf1e\n\nSolana is the blockchain the world has wanted, without the trade-offs we\u2019ve come to expect.

With the cold weather upon us and the time just right for holiday cheer, hot chocolate and warm fireplaces, come and gather around to hear and learn all about an ice cold Smart Protocol innovation! \u2744 \n\nWhat we\u2019re talking about is high-level creativity on display. What we\u2019re referencing is a well thought out idea coming together to form a masterpiece. What we are NOT talking about is just another coin! Now that we have your attention we would like to introduce you to *\u2018The coolest way to burn tokens\u2019*\u2026\n\nOn ***December 20th at 4 PM UTC*** the all new hyper-deflationary utility **$ICEBERG Token** will have the biggest fair launch of the year, and in a few brief points, here\u2019s why.\n\n\u2605 ***The ICEBERG Protocol***\n\nIs a cutting edge Auto-Vest-And-Burn system with Smart Locker utility. In other words the *ICEBERG Protocol* takes a percentage of tokens and auto-vests, or locks them away, in a secured digital storage bin called a Smart Locker. From here tokens are then burned on schedule in the future. This means that the **$ICEBERG Token** is built to burn, burn, burn! \ud83d\udd25 \n\n***The ICEBERG Team***\n\nIs made up of the core team from BabyCake. Frank Littiero is an award winning CEO and engaged leader who believes it is important to take time to listen and interact with investors. Together with Strategy Advisor Halo, they formed ICEBERG and appointed other key team members to join in making ICEBERG a huge success! \ud83d\ude4c\n\nICEBERG has several things that are very notable to mention. The team has a *website launching soon* with tokenomics and other important details listed in the ***ICEPAPER***! \ud83d\uddd2\n\n\u2605 ***ICEBERG Cross-Chain Swap***\n\nIs already developed and ready for release! The team has partnered with RUBIC to bring a swap allowing for interoperation between BSC and ETH, SOL, MATIC, AVAX and more! The resourcefulness and experience of the team has created an environment which benefits from existing partnerships and skills that empower them to get things done quickly. It\u2019s no wonder their first project soared to a $112 million dollar market cap in less than a week after launching! \ud83d\udce3\n\n***50% of Total Supply Will Be Burned*** over the first 50 days of being launched! The Auto-Vest-And-Burn Protocol will see 1% of the $ICEBERG total supply burned daily for 50 consecutive days! This is a first of its kind and will cause prices to soar as highly strategic marketing and promotion amplify the organic build-up of this highly anticipated launch!\n\n***3 Burn Mechanisms \ud83d\udc40***\n\nThat\u2019s right! Besides the supply burned from the Smart Locker there will also be *Transaction Burns* conducted constantly on every buy and sell. 1% of each token transaction will go to a ***BuyBack wallet*** which will perform strategic buybacks.\n\nThe third burn mechanism the team is excited to announce are ***Utility Burns!***\n\nRemember that ICEBERG Protocol?! Of course you do! The *ICEBERG Smart Locker* is the *already-developed utility and product* available for client utilization! Fees for use will be burned, rounding out a dynamic and evolved consistently burning token! \ud83d\udcb0\n\nThe **tokenomics** are very comfortable with a 7% buy and 10% sell tax already announced. *Marketing plans* will be released soon and with the team that ICEBERG has assembled we can expect them to be monumental! They are being very intentional and committed to increasing interest through completely organic measures. Anti-bot measures are in place from now through launch, covering all bases from community to contract. The **ICEBERG Telegram and Twitter** accounts have charted consistent increases in followers since being published just days ago.\n\nUnder the leadership of Halo and Frank **ICEBERG Labs** plans to create many huge projects and ideas in the future. For now the team wants to focus on this initial project and make **December 20th** a day to remember in the DeFi space with the biggest fair market launch of 2021! They have a very big idea with this hyper-deflationary, auto-vesting, always-burning $ICEBERG ecosystem being driven by that fresh new ice cold protocol. \ud83d\ude0e\n\n**Audits and listings** will also come very shortly, along with more partnerships and alliances to support the growth and expansion of the ICEBERG name and reach! This contract and project model is a no-brainer and sure to be a huge hit with the majority of investors nowadays seeking systems that work. Given the advanced, efficient ICEBERG Protocol there have been early mentions of comparisons with Safemoon. With the documented success of Frank, Halo and the team it would be safe to say that this launch will be an epic event! \ud83d\udca3\n\nSo there you have it. The final verdict is in and it says that you DEFINITELY want to be present and prepared for the Fair Market Launch of **$ICEBERG** \u2018*The coolest way to burn tokens\u2019*, as it has all the look and feel of a moonshot! \ud83c\udf11\n\nJOIN US\n\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/icebergprotocol\n\nTelegram: https:\/\/t.me\/icebergprotocol\n\n\ud83d\udd14 FAIR LAUNCH: December 20th, 2021 (at 4 pm UTC) here.\n\n*Article written by Bee Brown*\n\n  \n\n**Token Highlights**:\n\n\ud83d\udd1dLaunched by BabyCake Team\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Award Winning CEO\n\n\ud83c\udd95Innovative Protocol\n\n\ud83d\ude80Product\/Utility Already Developed\n\n\ud83d\udd253 Burn Mechanisms\n\n\ud83d\udcb5Buyback Feature\n\n\ud83d\udce2Huge Marketing\n\n\"The Coolest Way to Burn Tokens\"\n\n1% burn every day for 50 days and much more!\n\nWhat is ICEBERG\u2753\n\nICEBERG is a hyper-deflationary utility token fair launched on BEP-20.\n\n\ud83e\uddca UTILITY: \n\nICEBERG Protocol is the first Smart Locker which holds auto-vested tokens for future burns.

Coin is at about .004 cents. Thought I could tell you about it at this price it is pumping. I got most of mine around .003 https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/ixicash\n\n\nThis is my understanding.....\nIXI is a purist (non-sharded) high-TPS L1 with micro-transaction fees (few cents), with very low processing power and disk space requirements via novel consensus-based block acceptance. In comparison to Sol (another high TPS non-shard), cost of running a node is transparent and extremely low, which avoids all the \u201ccentralised\u201d data-centre issues of SOL.. e.g. this already has >1k nodes and they haven\u2019t really launched yet, vs Solana\u2019s ~600 where most are hosted by VC\/team.\n\nExpecting details of launch, marketing, and exchange listing details very soon. Announcement should also include confirmation they will finally add liquidity to Uniswap pool (liquidity is the biggest hurdle right now)....\n\nSo they are in \u201cbeta\u201d but have had the main DLT live testing and improving for ~2 years, stable and operating at 666 TPS (10k planned on V1 launch \u2013 Ethereum is 30 TPS). Also have a content delivery network S2 built on top for a completely decentralised and fully encrypted\/private end-to-end data transmission, with speeds easily capable of 4k video streaming, gaming, cloud services, VOIP\/video calls, messenger etc. \n\nAlready have an in-house fully encrypted & decentralised messenger\/VOIP dApp for both IOS & android which is dope, and soon being expanded to be a platform for include gaming, social media, video content live streaming, etc.... (should have more details with announcement i hope).\n\n5years old, built from scratch, public dev team w officially registered company, team tokens locked for another 2 years, yet they've been constantly building (even throughout the 2018-19 bear markets). Massive plans, 3 solid products already live, and so close to finally dropping V1.\n\n0 hype. No real mentions on CT. \n\n<$100M marketcap.\n\nCould be a decentralised Solana killer...  who knows... only a cool ~10,000x away","477":"I have serious trust issues with the BSC. I've been part of this community for as long as I can remember and there's a lot of projects that look at other investors, but never get answered.. What is their vision? And every time it feels like they say TOO THE MOON! The idea is always TOO THE MOON!\n\nI'm tired of people asking \"why\" when there are no answers or visions provided to justify their project, even if they come from investors like me who have reached out before in hopes that we'll work together one day but haven't gotten much response yet (not surprising).\n\nNow here comes Embr.. A project that didnt make outlandish promises. In fact they undersold themselves. Immediately I was intrigued. I saw people across the BSC community giving opinions that ranged from straight FUD to the other side of the spectrum, being extremely bullish.\u00a0\n\nSo I did what I do best. BE A SKEPTIC!\u00a0\n\nI did extensive research about their contracts. I saw the hesitancy people had about buying presale because of the vesting and if it really worked. Now i see the praises of how well it was executed. How easy it was to buy in and now retrieve their tokens after the fact. And most importantly.. Why they built these products in an attempt to mitigate all the nonsense that I see the community I care so much about brings up on a consistent basis!\n\nThen comes the big drop.. Their partnership with Wyre! They just partnered with Avalanche and Sol (Also did anyone else notice the tokenomics that SOL and EMBR has, that there is a lot of similarity??) !! If they are able to achieve with their app the ability to purchase tokens with a credit card and swap from another with Embr Swap. Does anyone see this as a game changer!?!?!\n\nI\u2019m a skeptic and a pessimist, but looking at the project and the litepaper, seeing what the team is doing. Am I finally given something thats at least justified in spending my timing researching and giving it a fair shake? \n\nWho else feels this way!?!? I want your input!

This is one of those projects like SOL, XOR or SPI that is going to sneak up on everyone and absolutely rip.  \n\n\nThis will be a long one, but it\u2019s worth your time. Due diligence on a long term hold in this market can be a life-changer. BP has a shot to be the next big thing.\n\n  \nIt can be challenging to identify gems fueled by fundamentals these days. There\u2019s admittedly a lot of foolery in crypto\u200a\u2014\u200aempty hype, VC dumps, hacks, poor marketing, etc. We\u2019re all tired of it, but at the same time, the haystack of nonsense makes it possible for legit game-changer investments to \u201chide\u201d as that proverbial needle.\n\n  \nPaying attention = major reward for the patient investor.\n\n  \n **That\u2019s where BP comes in.**\n\n  \nWhat problem does this solve? What value does it add to the world? \n\n  \n Right now the world of smart devices (Internet of Things, or IoT for short) is taking off. We\u2019re at this inflection point with mobile tech where smart watches, phones, refrigerators, etc. ad infinitum are all being built as computers. We\u2019re grafting smart functionality onto pretty much everything.\n\n  \n But it\u2019s kind of a mess right now with security lacking. Various companies are building devices and ecosystems that don\u2019t interact universally. All this IoT tech is developing in bubbles, isolated from true open interaction.\n\n  \n Basically we have a bunch of cool tech with tons of potential, being held back by corporate greed and security issues.\n\n  \n **Layer 0 tech that makes any and all smart devices worldwide to interact securely is what Beyond Protocol brings to the table.**\n\n  \n If they pull off becoming *the* standard (like TCP\/IP did for the modern internet, like Amazon did for online shopping, or like Apple and Android did for smartphones), this will be a complete paradigm shift that will touch the lives of billions.\n\n  \nSounds impossible at a glance, but so does every other world changing technology\u2026 BEFORE it actually succeeds. Then it \u201clooks obvious\u201d in hindsight.\n\n  \nWhy didn\u2019t everyone buy and hold Amazon stock in the late 90s? They just didn\u2019t envision it cashing in on its lofty goals.\n\n  \nThis is what you\u2019re looking at right here, the next Apple or Amazon for IoT. Mark my words, everything in a few years will be using Beyond Protocol for it\u2019s secure blockchain tech.\n\n  \nWill Beyond Protocol pull off becoming *the* base layer tech for all of IoT?

A bunch of highly intelligent, connected, successful people are aligning themselves with Jon Manzi and the rest of this team\u200a\u2014\u200aI imagine they\u2019re doing so for good reason.\n\n  \nSpeaking of Jon\u2026 this dude is 27, was a big deal at Stanford before he left to found his company, and made his first million at age 16. I dug up this article about him, looks like one of those maniacal perfectionist high achievers lol. I don\u2019t usually bet against people like this:\n\n[https:\/\/stanfordmag.org\/contents\/the-company-he-keeps](https:\/\/stanfordmag.org\/contents\/the-company-he-keeps)\n\n  \nRemember\u2026 asymmetric risk\/reward. These are the bets you want to make.\n\n  \nA couple of things to be aware of short term:  \n\n\n* mainnet launches in Q2 of 2022, so there will be an eventual token swap from ERC20 to native token  \n\n* a small group of early investors (I hear around 100 people) got in between $0.20 and $1, but they\u2019re all vested for 1\u20135 years\u2026 and recently voted in favor of deferred receipt of tokens in exchange for bonus payments in 2022 (if they wanted to take significant profits they\u2019d have wanted them asap, BP is trading at $30 right now after over a month on the market)\n\n  \nI consider this a big upside, long term bet. This is not the project you want to acquire and dump quickly- this is a long term hold. I\u2019d look to accumulate a nice chunk before mainnet if I was you,  then just forget about it for a while\u2026 projects with strong fundamentals tend to do really well once the tech actually launches. Think Solana, Cardano, etc. Heck, even the run-up in anticipation of launch can be explosive (Vectorspace AI recently).\n\n  \nDon\u2019t let this be one of those projects you heard about and never acted on, then see it way up in a few months.  \n\n\n**Consider this your early heads up.**   [https:\/\/beyond.link\/](https:\/\/beyond.link\/)","481":"\u267e CloudPad is an exceptionally protected launchpad with a two-step identification and internal KYC for founders, which provides an opportunity for investors to participate in projects developed on BSC, ERC, SOL ecosystems with credit card etc.\n\ud83c\udfa4 Pinksale Presale in 2 todays from today :\nToken Name: CLOUD\nTicker : $CLD\nToken Address: https:\/\/bscscan.com\/address\/0x095122c781520D5556c5CeB6b53Fb62db967c2F9\nPresale Time: 07.02 (18:00 UTC) - 09.02 (18:00 UTC)\n\nSoft\/Hard Cap: 100 BNB \/ 200 BNB\nMin\/Max: 0.1 BNB \/ 2 BNB\nToken Supply: 1,000,000,000\nPresale Rate: 1 BNB = 2,500,000 CLD\nListing Rate: 1 BNB = 2,000,000 CLD\nLiquidity: 80%\nLiquidity Lockup Time: 180 days after pool ends \n\n\n\u267e OUR VISION\nOur vision is to create a scam free community.\n\n\ud83d\udc41\u200d\ud83d\udde8 Remember To enter the Gleam Competition for the chance to be whitelisted in Tier 2\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/CloudPad1\/status\/1486046694907293698\n\nTokenomics :\n\n50% Presale Tokens available\n32% Automatic Liquidity Pool Fill + Lock\n9% Distributed to the CloudPad Team(splitted)\n6% Airdrop to big influencer(promotion)\n3% Distributed for community AirDrop\n\n\n\ud83d\uddde Whitepaper:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.officialcloudpad.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Whitepaper-CloudPad.pdf\n\nMore details coming soon, but will be great to get more eyes on the project and hopefully more members in the community \ud83d\ude80.

The Astroshit token will reward holders with 3 different core cryptocurrencies such as BNB\/BTC\/SOL, but depending on the week, they will offer independent projects the possibility to showcase their token via a buy-back service. This means that they will use the money from the tax for reflection to buy this partner token on the market in order to offer it in reflection to their holders, in parallel, this will cause an obvious increase in the price of the partner token due to the buy-back. This is a never-before-seen business model and a very smart one. In addition, Astroshit will offer unique, beautiful NFTs as part of the project. These are 10,000 totally unique, high-quality NFTs that will be mintable on their bespoke site and tradeable on the biggest NFT platforms. The minting will be available the day after the launch of the project. A lot of work has been done to ensure a seamless launch and offering of their NFTs right on launch.

This is our first token launch as token owners. We have previously worked on multiple teams assisting with marketing, listings, and community leadership positions, but we are now achieving our aspirations of operating our own business. We have responsibilities in several renowned cryptocurrency groups and decided it was time to unite all of our efforts and create something extraordinary.\n\nThe Panda Multiverse is first and foremost about its community and our commitment to helping one another, as well as our passion for Pandas!\n\nAside from that, we are a reward token that pays out 1% BUSD to token holders and 4% BUSD to token holders who also own one of our BSC NFTs (with the ability to bridge the others).\n\nWe are a cross-chain NFT platform that has an FPS P2E Zombie Panda game that rewards in legendary NFT pieces. We're also collaborating with other tokens to create their NFTs, giving further income and publicity back to the Panda multiverse. \n\nTokenomics\n\n2% LP\n\n6% MARKETING\n\nHolders of 4% NFT in BUSD\n\n2% NFT HOLDERS' WEEKLY PAYDAY\n\n1% DEV\n\nWe have announced a new collaboration with FarmerDoge!\n\nWe'll be performing their next NFTs alongside the great musician himself!\n\nIn addition, FarmerDoge will be cultivating Panda Multi-verse in the near future, which will bring us massive volume and new holders only from this collaboration!\n\nWe've also recently announced that each new investor who purchases a $50 minimum will receive a complimentary limited edition 8bit Panda NFT!\n\nWhere else can you buy a tiny quantity of tokens and receive an NFT as a welcome gift?\n\nPanda Multiverse is continually rewarding its fans with gifts and games based on our own Telegram and Discord communities!\n\nOur cross-chain NFT sales and ability to bridge them help us separate from other typical initiatives. And our FPS P2E Zombie Pandas game is on a completely different level of professionalism; it is nothing short of spectacular! This is a must-play for both gamers and crypto aficionados! Our game will include branding and marketing as though it were its own metaverse that changes over time. One of our more ambitious aims (you heard it here first) is to have a Panda multi-verse NFT Temple within the TCG metaverse. More specifics coming soon. We can't provide everything at once, and of course, our NFTs are hand-created masterpieces you can only acquire within the Panda multi-verse! \n\nOur initial 250 NFTs on BSC sold very quickly, leaving many people wanting more.\n\nSo, as we waited for our deal to be completed, we put an extra 250 on BSC, and they sold out even faster! We sold 550 NFTs in total in the run-up to our token launch, generating additional income for marketing and assisting with liquidity. \n\nWe are actively minting on SOL and searching for extra usefulness for SOL holders to profit from without needing to bridge back to BSC for incentives.\n\nIn addition to NFT purchases, the Panda Multiverse will generate other revenue streams through our P2E game, in which players may spend in-game money and other projects can pay to advertise in-game (2 already on board). In addition, we will offer a line of personalized clothes and one-of-a-kind shoes to help generate marketing income for the project. In addition, our NFT artists will collaborate with other projects on their NFTs, generating more revenue for the Panda Multiverse.\n\nWe're here to have a good time, trade beautiful art, form strong bonds, support the Pandas, and help one another grow as tall as the tallest bamboo! \n\n\"In an infinite multiverse, there is no such thing as fiction.\" PandaMultiverse\n\n   \n \n\n[http:\/\/t.me\/PandaMultiverse](http:\/\/t.me\/PandaMultiverse)\n\n[https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/panda-multiverse\/](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/panda-multiverse\/)\n\n[http:\/\/www.pandamultiversenft.com](http:\/\/www.pandamultiversenft.com\/)","523":"\n \n$100k marketing budget being spent in the buildup to the public presale next week!! \n \nJon Marianek (Jake Pauls manager) has been hired! \n \nGarret (Mrbeasts cousin) has been hired and is on board! \n \nTons coming in the next few days. \n \nBIGGEST youtuber on the scene booked \u2049\ufe0f \n \nWebsite being completely redesigned and will go live today \n \nThis is huge \n \nDev doxxing \ud83d\udc47 \n \nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/apesbinance\/status\/1415062347375333376?s=21 \n \nBinance apes - 100x moonshot \ud83e\udd8d \n  \nREWARDING IN XRP.

This IDO follows Chingari\u2019s recent live token sale on the Republic platform, where the Chingari team raised $12.3 million within 24 hours of listing \u2013 a new record in itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Chingari app has established itself as one of the fastest-growing social apps in India, racing ahead of prominent apps like Facebook, Reddit, and other homegrown short video apps like MX TakaTak, Moj, Josh, and several others. Per recent stats, the Chingari app has been downloaded over 85 million times and currently boasts of more than 32 million monthly active users.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositive about the $GARI token IDO, Chingari CEO and Co-Founder notes, \u201cThe $GARI crypto token is developed on the Solana blockchain network. It will allow content creators on the Chingari app to create their own eCommerce area, which will include actual items, develop NFT projects, and help consumers fund their favourite artists.

And this project isn\u2019t yet on CMC or CG. This is often reason enough to jump in. But with an mcap of $275k, this project could go 100x in a blink. Do I think this could do 1,000x? Maybe! Not straight away, but this is one of those rare projects that I think could. Given its current price I think might be able to hit those multiples over time, maybe even quite quickly!\n\nNon-custodial staking \u2013 hold in your wallet and earn. Real roadmap with utility to come. Ticks all my boxes.\n\nFor me, getting on to a centralised exchange so early shows some real committment from the dev team.\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nProject overview\n\nStraight away this project looks different to most of ones launching on BSC at the moment. I\u2019ll lay out the main differences:\n\nMax token supply \u2013 BitDiamond has a total supply of 21,000,000. Most new tokens lately have trillions if not quadrillions of tokens. It\u2019s easy to see why they are doing this. It\u2019s not just because it\u2019s a trend, there\u2019s a definite appeal to being able to buy BILLIONS of something, and of course it makes for eye catching increases. But all those numbers in metamask can be confusing to look at, and there is a lot to be said for a sensible low supply like BitDiamond\u2019s 21,000,000.\n\nQuality \/ Safety \u2013 The team looks to have gone to real effort here. The evidence is the audit from QuillHash they got even before the launch. Lots of tokens get audits after launch and all they are really looking to do is add to their marketing. The whole point of a smart contract audit is the auditor makes recommendations on code changes. Once a smart contract is deployed you can\u2019t make changes. BitDiamond have sought professional audit input on their token and then taken those actions before it\u2019s live. Also QuillHash have a good reputation, and their audits aren\u2019t cheap.\n\nLiquidity \u2013 97% of all tokens were added to the pool on launch and the load of the initial liquidity was with a decent amount of BUSD. Good liquidity is important. Also note the primary pair here is BUSD, so it\u2019s not been as affected by recent wild market swings.\n\nLocked Liquidity \u2013 Locked with unicrypt, the best in the business in my opinion. 50% for a year, 25% for three months and 25% for a month from launch.\n\nRoadmap \u2013 I had a chat with the dev team and they actually have a plan here! For them this token is the beginning, not the end goal. The first use case is a store of value with holders getting a share of a 4% tax on every transaction. But the dev team have already released a reward NFT to early holders and have more of these planned (they wouldn\u2019t give me the full details lol). A token with this low an mcap AND a plan to add utility? Yes please!\n\nFair launch \u2013 no pre-sale!\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nTokenomics\n\nNothing too complicated here. There is no burn. Every on-chain transaction is taxed 4% which is distributed to holders in proportion to their holding. To me this is good, basic tokenomics that make it good to HODL for the long-term.\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nWebsite \/ review of socials\n\nI like [btdmd.com](https:\/\/btdmd.com). It\u2019s not flashy, but there is good info there and links to all the socials. The telegram group seems to have a nice vibe and you often see the devs in there which is a good sign.\n\nOne thing that seems very different to me is the blog at [blog.btdmd.com](https:\/\/blog.btdmd.com). They clearly have a writer on the team as there is lots of good content there. Not just on the token, but on crypto in general. Gives me a good feel that they are in this for the long run.\n\nDiscord community not really happening at the moment, but I guess that will come?\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nPositive points:\n\n\\- Looks like a real project, not a cut and paste job e.g. the NFT rollout\n\n\\- I like the attention on safety, the audit and locking liquidity etc\n\n\\- Blog is nice and well written\n\n\\- Anti-snipe \/ whale feature. Not sure how well it works though?\n\n\\- Liquidity is excellent!\n\n\\- Next up CMC, CG, merch and exchanges. This could blow up massively!\n\n\\- Already on a centralised exchange\n\nNegative points:\n\n\\- It\u2019s new, so I guess there is a risk (but risk = reward, right?!). \n\n\\- There are other non-custodial staking options out there. I like the low supply and roadmap on this one (and most of all the crazy low mcap!), but I guess there are other options.\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nInfo from their socials, always do your own research people!:\n\nBitDiamond, A decentralised store of value on BSC\n\nEXCELLENT LIQUIDITY: No large team wallet, 97% of tokens added to liquidity.\n\nLIQUIDITY LOCKED: 50% for 1 year, 25% for three months, 25% for one month\n\nONE AUDIT COMPLETE SO FAR: Audit by top audit company QuillHash.

When someone buys $CCC they earn passive income and get exposure to multiple high quality investments which will raise the price of $CCC over time.\n\n#####Crypto has brought a lot of new users in the past year, but many are confused about where to invest their money, how to earn passive income, or how to find a community where they can learn about new projects and investment strategies.

This IDO follows Chingari\u2019s recent live token sale on the Republic platform, where the Chingari team raised $12.3 million within 24 hours of listing \u2013 a new record in itself.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy I believe this could go a 1000X in the near future \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude80Backed by Alameda Research (owners of FTX) and Kraken Ventures.

Per recent stats, the Chingari app has been downloaded over 85 million times and currently boasts of more than 32 million monthly active users.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositive about the $GARI token IDO, Chingari CEO and Co-Founder notes, \u201cThe $GARI crypto token is developed on the Solana blockchain network. It will allow content creators on the Chingari app to create their own eCommerce area, which will include actual items, develop NFT projects, and help consumers fund their favourite artists.

This is one of those projects like SOL, XOR or SPI that is going to sneak up on everyone and absolutely rip.  \n\n\nThis will be a long one, but it\u2019s worth your time. Due diligence on a long term hold in this market can be a life-changer. BP has a shot to be the next big thing.\n\n  \nIt can be challenging to identify gems fueled by fundamentals these days. There\u2019s admittedly a lot of foolery in crypto\u200a\u2014\u200aempty hype, VC dumps, hacks, poor marketing, etc. We\u2019re all tired of it, but at the same time, the haystack of nonsense makes it possible for legit game-changer investments to \u201chide\u201d as that proverbial needle.\n\n  \nPaying attention = major reward for the patient investor.\n\n  \n **That\u2019s where BP comes in.**\n\n  \nWhat problem does this solve? What value does it add to the world? \n\n  \n Right now the world of smart devices (Internet of Things, or IoT for short) is taking off. We\u2019re at this inflection point with mobile tech where smart watches, phones, refrigerators, etc. ad infinitum are all being built as computers. We\u2019re grafting smart functionality onto pretty much everything.\n\n  \n But it\u2019s kind of a mess right now with security lacking. Various companies are building devices and ecosystems that don\u2019t interact universally. All this IoT tech is developing in bubbles, isolated from true open interaction.\n\n  \n Basically we have a bunch of cool tech with tons of potential, being held back by corporate greed and security issues.\n\n  \n **Layer 0 tech that makes any and all smart devices worldwide to interact securely is what Beyond Protocol brings to the table.**\n\n  \n If they pull off becoming *the* standard (like TCP\/IP did for the modern internet, like Amazon did for online shopping, or like Apple and Android did for smartphones), this will be a complete paradigm shift that will touch the lives of billions.\n\n  \nSounds impossible at a glance, but so does every other world changing technology\u2026 BEFORE it actually succeeds. Then it \u201clooks obvious\u201d in hindsight.\n\n  \nWhy didn\u2019t everyone buy and hold Amazon stock in the late 90s? They just didn\u2019t envision it cashing in on its lofty goals.\n\n  \nThis is what you\u2019re looking at right here, the next Apple or Amazon for IoT. Mark my words, everything in a few years will be using Beyond Protocol for it\u2019s secure blockchain tech.\n\n  \nWill Beyond Protocol pull off becoming *the* base layer tech for all of IoT? Maybe, maybe not. We can only speculate. What I can say factually is nobody is closer right now.\n\n  \n**Just look at this insane press list:**  \n\n\n* [**Cisco Systems** partnership to enable the metaverse at the Field of Dreams](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/beyond-protocol-and-heads-and-tails-inc-form-investment-group-to-keep-the-dream-alive-at-the-field-of-dreams-301396442.html)\n* [**Vanderbilt University** partnership, development of wearable biometric monitoring](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/beyond-protocol-partners-with-vanderbilt-university-on-biometric-wearable-technology-301418002.html)\n* [NFL star **Rob Gronkowski** signed to a multi-year contract as a Beyond Protocol brand ambassador, also relating to biometric performance monitoring](https:\/\/www.foxbusiness.com\/sports\/rob-gronkowski-blockchain-nutrition-sports-medicine)\n* [Former Joe Biden Senior Advisor under the Obama Administration, **Moe Vela** has joined the team as an official advisor](https:\/\/twitter.com\/beyondprotocol1\/status\/1410281814279741440)\n* [**Cage The Elephant** lead singer Matt Shultz is an official partner, wearing a custom biometric data capturing suit to his concerts moving forward, capturing Patient Health Info and transmitting securely via Beyond Protocol](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/beyond-protocol-and-cage-the-elephant-frontman-matthew-ray-shultz-will-bring-unhackable-blockchain-to-performances-301390095.html)\n\n  \nThis is just recent stuff too as there is a lot going on here behind the scenes.

This is not the project you want to acquire and dump quickly- this is a long term hold. I\u2019d look to accumulate a nice chunk before mainnet if I was you,  then just forget about it for a while\u2026 projects with strong fundamentals tend to do really well once the tech actually launches.

The token reached an *ATH MarketCap of $112 Million* and won 3 awards this fall at the DeFi Summit and Crypto Expo in Dubai!\n\nBabyCake\u2019s CAKE reflection smart contract design was so popular that it was forked over 250 times! This team knows what they are doing and they are pulling together all of the necessary elements to ensure a meteoric launch tomorrow! Not to mention, ICEBERG is aiming to have the fairest, cleanest launch on the Binance Smart Chain this year.  *ICEBERG will certainly benefit* from the big ideas and proven track record of this very capable team! \n\n\ud83d\udc8e**Hyper-Deflationary Token**\n\nIn the dictionary the term *hyper-deflationary should have ICEBERG next to it!* Seriously. **ICEBERG is built to burn!** When a token burns like this it\u2019s hard not to consider that it is going to have a  bright future price!

Their goal is to create highly innovative projects and solve liquidity-related issues that stifle many projects in the DeFi space.\n\n**What is the Iceberg Protocol?**\n\nThe ICEBERG Protocol is a game-changing Protocol that enables Smart Supply Management through a process of Auto-Vesting and Burning tokens on a predefined schedule. The tokens are secured in a Smart Contract whose sole function is to \u2018Burn\u2019. They are locked and vested for a predetermined period of time and a percentage of the tokens are burned on Schedule. This enables a consistent decrease in the supply of tokens and an equally consistent increase of the price of the token.\n\n**Have the founders been doxxed?**\n\nCo-founder and CEO Frank has been fully doxxed and was an award-winning Speaker at the Dubai Crypto Conference in Dubai in 2021 as well as a featured speaker at Dubai DeFi Conference. \n\n**What are $ICEBERG Tokenomics.**\n\n*7% tax on Buys*\n\n6% - for ICEBERG Labs (LP, Marketing and Development)\n\n1% - Buyback\n\n*10% tax on Sales*\n\n9% - ICEBERG Labs (LP, Marketing and Development)\n\n1% - Buyback\n\n**How can I buy $ICEBERG?**\n\nYou can buy Iceberg on the Swap, the Cross Chain Swap on the Iceberg Website (link) or on PancakeSwap.[ https:\/\/pancakeswap.finance\/swap](https:\/\/pancakeswap.finance\/swap)\n\n**What is the Total Supply?**\n\nIceberg\u2019s total supply is 100 Million\n\n**What is the Contract address?**\n\nTBA\n\n**What is the recommended Slippage?**\n\nUse slippage between 8% to 10%.\n\nTo use 1% slippage lower the amount of Iceberg and add .01\n\ne.g. 900,000 > 880,000.01\n\n**Is Iceberg SAFU?**\n\nThe Iceberg contract is currently being audited by both Certik and Techrate.The results will be posted shortly.\n\nPoints Highlighted:\n\n\ud83d\udc8eCreated by a Successful Team\n\n\\- $ICEBERG co-founders are Halo & Frank, co-founder and award-winning CEO of BabyCake respectively\n\n\\- BabyCake reached an ATH MarketCap of $112 Million\n\n\\- Winner of 3 awards in Dubai\n\n\\- Smart Contract was forked over 250 times!\n\n\ud83d\udc8eProduct Already Developed\n\n\\- ICEBERG Protocol\u2019s Smart Locker has already been developed and is available.\n\n\\- Our first client has already signed up for the LP Solution!\n\n\\- Rubic Cross-Chain Swap is complete and ready-to-use!\n\n\ud83d\udc8eExperienced Marketing Team & Strategy\n\n\\- Reload \ud83d\udd04 $112 Million MC in other project (The team has gotten wiser!)\n\n\\- Highly Skilled Team has developed an aggressive marketing plan which integrates Influencers, Poocoin, Reddit, Telegram, Twitter and more.\n\n\\- Huge marketing budget will drive massive exposure!\n\n\\- Partnerships with Influencers\n\n\\- Chinese Telegram group\n\n\ud83e\uddcaLP Locked\n\n\ud83e\uddcaCertik and Techrate Audits incoming\n\n\ud83e\uddcaFAIR.

The team says they are also sick of low-quality tokens on BSC, and set out to make the very best quality token they could.\nThey started by getting an audit from top smart contract security auditor Quillhash, before the launch. They added almost all of the tokens (97%) into liquidity and locked that on unicrypt. There was no pre-sale, but rather a fair launch with a focus on slow and steady growth. And an anti-whale feature means that every transaction, buy or sell, is limited to a maximum of 1% of supply.\n\nBitDiamond has a nice sensible total supply of 21,000,000. There is no contract burn, either auto or manual. A 4% tax is applied to every on-chain transaction, with that tax being distributed to all holders in proportion to their holding. Good for HODL.\n\nFurther from that, the team are very focussed on providing top quality information to their holders. Their website is nicely laid out, and they blog actively both on the project and also crypto issues in general. You get the real sense that this team is in it for the long-haul.\n\nThe token is now two week\u2019s old and hasn\u2019t taken off yet. But you can sense that it\u2019s coming out from under the radar now, and interest in a high-quality product at a very low mcap is picking up.\n\nAnyone buying in here will still be very early. The team applied to CMC and CG just after launch and neither listing has come through yet, so there is still that to come. Plus they aren\u2019t shy about marketing, having already paid for a main channel waterfall ad, and with a gleam promotion to give away a real diamond! Plus they have just yesterday started rolling out some NFTs! Where this is going I\u2019m not sure.\n\nThis token looks to be about as safe as they come on BSC and is primed to do some serious multiples. Not financial advice, obviously, but it\u2019s probably time to jump in to this one.\n\nPros:\n- Obvious effort gone into safety with the audit and locking liquidity with unicrypt\n- Anti-snipe \/ whale feature is nice, though probably mainly useful on launch I guess\n- Active blog suggests real effort going in, not just into marketing\n- Actual devs, if the NFT rollout is any indication\n- Really good liquidity\n- Making really good progress through the roadmap. Next is the merch store and exchanges.\n\nCons:\n- New, not many holders yet.\n- Are they any different to other low mcap tokens? Probably too early to tell.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nReposting information from their website \/ socials, as always, DYOR:\n\nBitDiamond, A decentralised store of value on BSC\n\nEXCELLENT LIQUIDITY: No large team wallet, 97% of tokens added to liquidity.\nLIQUIDITY LOCKED: 50% for 1 year, 25% for three months, 25% for one month\nONE AUDIT COMPLETE SO FAR: Audit by top audit company QuillHash.

Get in early whilst you still can.*  \n \n\n**MoonCharts** is powered by PolyMoon \u2013 the first SafeMoon fork on Polygon with fairer tokenomics. So already, holders are rewarded with reflections thanks to 10% fee \u2013 8% into liquidity and 2% to holders.   \n \n\nThen, there\u2019s single asset staking and LP staking to farm Polycake, giving holders further revenue whilst not farming PolyMoon so it\u2019s value doesn\u2019t drop.   \n \n\nFinally, the fully functional platform will share ad and platform revenue with PolyMoon stakers to create more passive income.  \n \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk charts. You\u2019ve used dextools or poocoin, or god forbid anything on Polygon right now. Slow performance, poor UI, cluttered with cheap and nasty ads or no historical data. All of them suffer with one or more of the above.\n\n**MoonCharts** is designed from the ground up to be high performance. Whereas other charting platforms use The Graph to ingest data and can take days to re-index, MoonCharts will take hours (and in the future minutes) to re-index.  \n \n\nThis is a massive problem that many platforms are facing, from CoinGecko to QuickSwap. That means, many places that will want to partner with them to take advantage of their tech. They\u2019re already in talks with some big names who are eager to test the alpha.  \n \n\nMoonCharts is solving this problem by creating a completely bespoke data ingestion pipeline, among other cool, unique tech, built by Google-accredited devs who worked with Google on previous projects before going fulltime crypto. (Based devs ftw)  \n \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk roadmap.\n\n[Roadmap](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/5dgscCz)\n\n**Alpha:** Charting. It\u2019s pretty simple but you gotta walk before you can run. The devs are working hard to solve all the tiny little bugs before rolling out sometime this month, after said bugs are fixed and performance is optimized. They want to have the whole Polygon network indexed for alpha.  \n \n\n**Beta:** UX Improvements and Mobile optimization. Once it\u2019s in the hands of PolyMoon holders (who will have exclusive access to the alpha) the team will take feedback to finesse the experience before launch.  \n \n\n**Launch:** Once it\u2019s live, this is where the team start to generate revenue to distribute to stakers that won\u2019t tank the price of the charts native token, PolyMoon (looking at you Dextools). The Built-in dex tools, ad integration and leaderboards will be tastefully designed and not intrude on the experience. Rumor has it a partnership is close to announcement for the leaderboards, which will be relevant to \u201cvetted\u201d gems. Watch this space.  \n \n\n**Future:** Once it\u2019s live on Polygon (which desperately needs good charts) then it\u2019s on to every other popular blockchain such as BSC, ETH, DOT, SOL, FTM, etc. There will be platform landscapes and indexes to help you find the next gem. DeFi dashboard to help you keep track of your pile of gems and jewels. TG integration to bring more users onto the platform as passive marketing tool. And most important of all Premium Features that will be reserved for PolyMoon holders. The amount required has not been disclosed yet so grab a bag whilst it\u2019s on sale.  \n \n\nSpeaking of, let\u2019s quick look at the J curve. For those that don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a great way to find out where a project is at in it\u2019s lifecycle. If you look below, MoonCharts is nearing the end of stage 2.   \n\n\n[J Curve](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/wamEX79)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPolyMoon hit an $18m mcap before it even announced MoonCharts, before it started heavy price action marketing. Now it\u2019s leaving the end of phase 2 and the charts are starting to roll out, where do you expect the price to go? \n\n \n\n**\ud83d\udd75** **Anti-Rug Scam Programme with other Polygon Projects:**\n\n\u00b7 STRG - Save The Rugged Guys (for Polymus refugees)\n\nWe care about people who have lost their investments in rug pulled projects.

DxSale\u2019s goal is unlike other launchpads in that they are not a curated launchpad (no vetting of tokens being launched) and do not require the developers launching the project, or buyers of potential projects to hold $SALE to participate. On it\u2019s face this appears as a negative as it doesn\u2019t incentivize holding the token. However it aligns with their goal, to be a decentralized launchpad where anyone can participate and prospective investors are responsible for doing their own research. In addition to their launchpad they currently also have DxLocker which is a product used to lock tokens either for set period of time or according to a vesting schedule which gives investors the assurances and visibility of when developers can sell their tokens or deplete the liquidity pool. In addition, they have plans for additional products with DxSwap, DxNFT, and DxFarm to come in Q4. With the rollout of V3 which started August 26th In short, DxSale\u2019s goal of being a truly decentralized platform for any blockchain in accordance with the principles of DeFi and cryptocurrency as a whole.\n \nCurrently they have the following networks available on their platform available for IDOs and available to utilize DxLocker.\n \n* Ethereum \u2013 Added Feb 24th\n\n* Binance Smart Chain \u2013 Added Feb 24th\n\n* Matic\/Polygon \u2013 Added March 9th\n\n* Avalanche \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* Fantom \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* Harmony \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* xDai \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* OKEx \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n* KCC - Added mid July\n\n* Cardano - Coming Soon with V3.5\n\n* Solana - Coming Soon with V3.5\n \n**Launches**\n \nThere are two parts of the launchpad standard token launch or DeFi launches. Standard token launches are pre-defined contracts where DxSale retains ownership of the contract and compared to the DeFi launchpad are relatively safe. The majority of token launches however are taking place on the DeFi launchpad. This is where anyone can launch their DeFi project and where we have seen projects like SafeMoon etc. launch. Yes reddits favorite coin was the 8th project to launch on DxSale. This platform has exploded they have had over 15,000 projects attempted launch with about 3,500 meeting minimum funds raised needed to finalize. This is where things get interesting from a revenue prospective. \n\n **DxSale's cut:**\n\n- DxSale takes a cut of every presale with a fee to list (1 BNB) and they take a portion of every presale launch\u2019s revenue (2%), and a portion of the projects tokens (2%). \n \n**Revenue Streams:**\n\n- DxSale\u2019s cut from presales is listed above however they have other revenue streams as well. DxMint which is a tool that makes it easy to create an approved contract from DxSale with adjustable tax amounts (1BNB). Token Locker (.1 BNB per lock) and a Whitelist function (1 BNB). In addition there are more revenue streams coming. Penalty withdraw will allow users who buy into a presale to withdraw their funds before the token launches with a penalty fee if after investing and not doing their research they realize the project is a scam. With v3 a few new revenue streams were introduced. Emergency withdraw allows people to withdraw their funds after investing in a presale with a 20% penalty going to the revenue pool. In addition DxFairLaunch and DxDrop are also two new dApps which will bring additional revenue. \n\n\n**\u201cWhat all these shitcoins I\u2019ve been hearing about are coming from here?! How have I not heard of this? And they have a token?\u201d**\n\n- Yes! Why haven\u2019t you heard of it? Because we have the most Sigma dev\u2019s on the planet. These guys from a coding perspective are all stars. No other platforms have as many chains, no other platform is this successful. However, they have not even begun to market. Instead, they have building, ensuring everything is in place. Due to revenue, they now have more than enough to maintain salaries for their team through any bear market. They have fixed small issues that have caused support requests taking up their time. Now however with V3 launching they are beginning to market the project to bring in more developers on the platform and more revenue for buy and burn. \n\n\n**This is where the fun begins Tokenomics and revenue.** \n\n- So why did I go into this looong explanation about what DxSale is and their revenue? Because it all plays into the Tokenomics and why I haven\u2019t sold a single $SALE and only accumulated. I have been doing this the entire bull run, felt like that meme with Squiward looking out the window at Patrick and SpongeBob having fun with their 10-100xs while I held SALE. SALE however is a sure thing, it was guaranteed to go up why? Because of Buy and Burn Tokenomics. DxSale has gone through a few iterations of their token model before buy and burn there was a clunky staking mechanism where we were airdropped more SALE tokens. The Devs however then came up with this buy and burn model and got rid of staking. This cut out the middleman causing two effects, one the initial buy of the token increases the price, two the token is then burned further reducing the supply. The net effect for token holders was same as staking but much simpler to implement and doesn\u2019t require you to stake. [Lets look at the chart as of today.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/GcK53YC) As you can see all bull run SALE has been crabbing between a low of .10 and brief highs near .40-.50. However SALE has been on a tear recently thanks to[ buy and burn](https:\/\/imgur.com\/GcK53YC). The volume for this coin is stupid low because we have had almost no new buyers due to no marketing or shilling. Almost all gains have been from the devs buying and burning the token. I outlined the revenue streams, the revenue is distributed as 50% for the devs and 50% for buy and burn.\n \n\n**Now lets take a look at revenue (these graphs were put together by members of the community from analysis tool)**\n\n[Total amount of projects that have successfully raised funds and launched \\(2% of Raised funds and 2% of project tokens split between devs and buy and burn\\)](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LcsN2Ey)\n \n- 3,500\n\n[Total amount of projects that have attempted launch \\(1 BNB Fee each\\)](https:\/\/imgur.com\/K4vZXaB)\n\n- 10,000\n\n[Monthly Revenue](https:\/\/imgur.com\/5gZPfDj)\n\n\n[Amount of money left for buy and burn from fees](https:\/\/imgur.com\/MRqcrAk) 1,297,006\n\n[Amount of project tokens remaining to be sold for buy and burn](https:\/\/imgur.com\/Laemfsz) 2,800,000\n\n\n(Actual dollar amounts higher, taken snapshot before this past days price rise)\n\n\n\n**In conclusion**\n\nAs I and the community have observed the platform just keeps increasing in popularity even through the mini bear market we just had. I have been seeing these numbers all along and that\u2019s why I decided instead of trying to swing trade other projects to just hold SALE for now. Before buy and burn SALE was trading at NEGATIVE 4x earnings annualized\u2026 which is ridiculous.  With the amount of revenue for buy and burn sitting in the current wallets spending it all now would push SALE over 5.00. Now consider that weekly revenue has been outpacing weekly buy and burns. \n\n\nTherefore I am very comfy holding my SALE based on analyzing the Tokenomics, tracking the projects progress, chatting with the devs, and building relationships in the community of whom I consider friends. Am I saying you should buy SALE? NO, I\u2019m saying I really don\u2019t give a shit if you buy SALE hell no one else has to buy SALE the revenue will keep the token price increases and the community of SALErs and I cruise to the moon.","556":"Welcome Dear Investor\ud83d\udc8e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udcde [https:\/\/t.me\/solxbsc](https:\/\/t.me\/solxbsc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIntroducing SOLX, not just a meme but with upcoming utility\u2747\ufe0f\n\n&#x200B;\n\n==========================================================\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019re building Solana defi infrastructure to make it more friendly to BSC\/ETH investors.

Due diligence on a long term hold in this market can be a life-changer. And I think BP has a shot to be the next big thing.\n\nAsymmetric risk\/reward, right?\n\nAnyways, it can be challenging to identify actual gems fueled by fundamentals these days. There\u2019s admittedly a lot of foolery in crypto\u200a\u2014\u200aempty hype, VC dumps, hacks, poor marketing, etc. We\u2019re all tired of it, but at the same time, the haystack of nonsense makes it possible for legit game-changer investments to \u201chide\u201d as that proverbial needle.\n\nPaying attention = major come-ups for the patient investor.  \n\n\n**Enter BP.**  **\ud83d\udcc8** \n\n  \nFirstly, what problem does this solve? What value does it add to the world? \n\nRight now, the world of smart devices (Internet of Things, or IoT for short) is taking off. We\u2019re at this inflection point with mobile tech, where smart watches, phones, refrigerators, etc. ad infinitum are all being built as computers. We\u2019re grafting smart functionality onto pretty much everything.\n\nBut it\u2019s kind of a mess right now. Various companies are building devices and ecosystems that don\u2019t interact universally. All this IoT tech is developing in bubbles, isolated from true open interaction.\n\nBasically we have a bunch of cool tech with tons of potential, being held back by corporate greed and security issues.\n\n**Beyond Protocol is a Layer 0 tech that enables any and all smart devices worldwide to interact securely.**\n\nIf they pull off becoming *the* standard (like TCP\/IP did for the modern internet, like Amazon did for online shopping, or like Apple and Android did for smartphones), this will be a complete paradigm shift that will touch the lives of billions.\n\nSo yeah, there\u2019s your hype. Sounds far-fetched at a glance, but so does every other world changing technology\u2026 BEFORE it actually succeeds. Then it \u201clooks obvious\u201d in hindsight.\n\nThis is why most people didn\u2019t buy and hold Amazon stock in the late 90s. Just didn\u2019t envision it cashing in on its lofty goals.\n\nWill Beyond Protocol pull off becoming *the* base layer tech for all of IoT? Maybe, maybe not. But nobody is closer right now.\n\n**Nobody is here, ready with the tech, and making the right connections in business, academia, and politics:**\n\n* [**Cisco Systems** partnership to enable the metaverse at the Field of Dreams](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/beyond-protocol-and-heads-and-tails-inc-form-investment-group-to-keep-the-dream-alive-at-the-field-of-dreams-301396442.html)\n* [**Vanderbilt University** partnership, development of wearable biometric monitoring](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/beyond-protocol-partners-with-vanderbilt-university-on-biometric-wearable-technology-301418002.html)\n* [NFL star **Rob Gronkowski** signed to a multi-year contract as a Beyond Protocol brand ambassador, also relating to biometric performance monitoring](https:\/\/www.foxbusiness.com\/sports\/rob-gronkowski-blockchain-nutrition-sports-medicine)\n* [Former Joe Biden Senior Advisor under the Obama Administration, **Moe Vela** has joined the team as an official advisor](https:\/\/twitter.com\/beyondprotocol1\/status\/1410281814279741440)\n* [**Cage The Elephant** lead singer Matt Shultz is an official partner, wearing a custom biometric data capturing suit to his concerts moving forward, capturing Patient Health Info and transmitting securely via Beyond Protocol](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/beyond-protocol-and-cage-the-elephant-frontman-matthew-ray-shultz-will-bring-unhackable-blockchain-to-performances-301390095.html)\n\n  \nThis is just recent stuff too, there\u2019s a lot going on here behind the scenes. A bunch of highly intelligent, connected, successful people are aligning themselves with Jon Manzi and the rest of this team\u200a\u2014\u200aI imagine they\u2019re doing so for good reason.\n\nSpeaking of Jon\u2026 this dude is 27, was a big deal at Stanford before he left to found his company, and made his first million at age 16. I dug up this article about him, looks like one of those maniacal perfectionist high achievers lol. I don\u2019t usually bet against people like this:\n\n  \n[https:\/\/stanfordmag.org\/contents\/the-company-he-keeps](https:\/\/stanfordmag.org\/contents\/the-company-he-keeps)\n\n  \nRemember\u2026 asymmetric risk\/reward. These are the bets you want to make.\n\nA couple of things to be aware of short term:\n\n* mainnet launches in Q2 of 2022, so there will be an eventual token swap from ERC20 to native token\n* a small group of early investors (I hear around 100 people) got in between $0.20 and $1, but they\u2019re all vested for 1\u20135 years\u2026 and recently voted in favor of deferred receipt of tokens in exchange for bonus payments in 2022 (if they wanted to take significant profits they\u2019d have wanted them asap, BP is trading at $30 right now after over a month on the market)\n\n  \nUltimately, I consider this a big upside long term bet. I\u2019d look to accumulate a nice chunk before mainnet, then just forget about it for a while\u2026 projects with strong fundamentals tend to do really well once the tech actually launches. Again, think Solana, Cardano, etc. Heck, even the run-up in anticipation of launch can be explosive (Vectorspace AI recently).\n\n  \nDon\u2019t let this be one of those projects you heard about and never acted on, then see it way up in a few months. Consider this your early heads up.  **\ud83d\udcc8**","559":"Doge Unchained (DUC) is building a Dogecoin-backed DeFi ecosystem as the first ever token paired to wrapped-Doge.

We have responsibilities in several renowned cryptocurrency groups and decided it was time to unite all of our efforts and create something extraordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Panda Multiverse is first and foremost about its community and our commitment to helping one another, as well as our passion for Pandas!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from that, we are a reward token that pays out 1% BUSD to token holders and 4% BUSD to token holders who also own one of our BSC NFTs (with the ability to bridge the others).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are a cross-chain NFT platform that has an FPS P2E Zombie Panda game that rewards in legendary NFT pieces.

Up, down and sideways, influenced by a variety of dudes and nations. Been one hell of a roller-coaster ride, but I don\u2019t think the markets are going to get bearish anytime soon. I am a gem hunter. Nothing gives me satisfaction like the thrill of hunting down that next 100x in a sea of scams and moonshots. Ive gotten lucky quite a few times and I do not think my luck is going to run out anytime soon. Especially with SolSports.\n\nWhat is SolSports? They describe themselves as a decentralized bet-maker, tournament organizer and NFT marketplace for the E-sports community. They have 4 core products, whose beta versions will be released in the coming months:\n\u25fb\ufe0f Bet Maker \u2013 Allows you to bet against anyone in games such as Dota 2, CS:GO, etc.\n\u25fb\ufe0f Pitch Bet \u2013 Make your betting track-record public, so others can piggy-back on your bets for a fee.\n\u25fb\ufe0f E-Sports Organizer \u2013 Host your own tournaments and organize bets around it.\n\u25fb\ufe0f NFT Marketplace \u2013 Mint your own NFTS. A good add-on for gamers and tournament creators.\n\nAll these products will use the SolSports token in order to unlock their value. If this does not scream use-case, I don\u2019t know what does.\n\nThe platform itself will be built on Solana in order to take advantage of insane transaction speeds and dirt-cheap fees. They are doing a partial token sale on BSC too, in order to steal and onboard some of those BSC defi-users. I think it\u2019s a brilliant strategy, BSC is indeed a juicy market and a gigantic DEFI hub.\n\nWhat games will SolSports support?\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Dota 2 (first game to be supported)\n\u2611\ufe0f Valorant\n\u2611\ufe0f CS:GO\n\u2611\ufe0f Hearthstone \n\nIn addition to this, they have identified 12 more games that will be integrated with Bet Maker and our other products, which will be revealed through partnership announcements. \n\nThey also plan to make SolSports the go-to platform for e-sports wagering, all done through the SolSports token. Check out their website and read the official documentation to learn more.\n\nWhat really excites me are the industries they are operating in: Gaming and betting. They are both mammoth industries, with market sizes of around$65 billion and $200 billion respectively. If SolSports manages to drive just 0.01% of these industry\u2019s participants to use their platform, how much do you think SolSports will be worth?  And the fun part is, their token sale is still ongoing. You can get in on the ground floor.

With the cold weather upon us and the time just right for holiday cheer, hot chocolate and warm fireplaces, come and gather around to hear and learn all about an ice cold Smart Protocol innovation! \u2744 \n\nWhat we\u2019re talking about is high-level creativity on display. What we\u2019re referencing is a well thought out idea coming together to form a masterpiece. What we are NOT talking about is just another coin! Now that we have your attention we would like to introduce you to *\u2018The coolest way to burn tokens\u2019*\u2026\n\nOn ***December 20th at 4 PM UTC*** the all new hyper-deflationary utility **$ICEBERG Token** will have the biggest fair launch of the year, and in a few brief points, here\u2019s why.\n\n\u2605 ***The ICEBERG Protocol***\n\nIs a cutting edge Auto-Vest-And-Burn system with Smart Locker utility. In other words the *ICEBERG Protocol* takes a percentage of tokens and auto-vests, or locks them away, in a secured digital storage bin called a Smart Locker. From here tokens are then burned on schedule in the future. This means that the **$ICEBERG Token** is built to burn, burn, burn! \ud83d\udd25 \n\n***The ICEBERG Team***\n\nIs made up of the core team from BabyCake. Frank Littiero is an award winning CEO and engaged leader who believes it is important to take time to listen and interact with investors. Together with Strategy Advisor Halo, they formed ICEBERG and appointed other key team members to join in making ICEBERG a huge success! \ud83d\ude4c\n\nICEBERG has several things that are very notable to mention. The team has a *website launching soon* with tokenomics and other important details listed in the ***ICEPAPER***! \ud83d\uddd2\n\n\u2605 ***ICEBERG Cross-Chain Swap***\n\nIs already developed and ready for release! The team has partnered with RUBIC to bring a swap allowing for interoperation between BSC and ETH, SOL, MATIC, AVAX and more! The resourcefulness and experience of the team has created an environment which benefits from existing partnerships and skills that empower them to get things done quickly. It\u2019s no wonder their first project soared to a $112 million dollar market cap in less than a week after launching! \ud83d\udce3\n\n***50% of Total Supply Will Be Burned*** over the first 50 days of being launched! The Auto-Vest-And-Burn Protocol will see 1% of the $ICEBERG total supply burned daily for 50 consecutive days! This is a first of its kind and will cause prices to soar as highly strategic marketing and promotion amplify the organic build-up of this highly anticipated launch!\n\n***3 Burn Mechanisms \ud83d\udc40***\n\nThat\u2019s right! Besides the supply burned from the Smart Locker there will also be *Transaction Burns* conducted constantly on every buy and sell. 1% of each token transaction will go to a ***BuyBack wallet*** which will perform strategic buybacks.\n\nThe third burn mechanism the team is excited to announce are ***Utility Burns!***\n\nRemember that ICEBERG Protocol?! Of course you do! The *ICEBERG Smart Locker* is the *already-developed utility and product* available for client utilization! Fees for use will be burned, rounding out a dynamic and evolved consistently burning token! \ud83d\udcb0\n\nThe **tokenomics** are very comfortable with a 7% buy and 10% sell tax already announced. *Marketing plans* will be released soon and with the team that ICEBERG has assembled we can expect them to be monumental! They are being very intentional and committed to increasing interest through completely organic measures. Anti-bot measures are in place from now through launch, covering all bases from community to contract. The **ICEBERG Telegram and Twitter** accounts have charted consistent increases in followers since being published just days ago.\n\nUnder the leadership of Halo and Frank **ICEBERG Labs** plans to create many huge projects and ideas in the future. For now the team wants to focus on this initial project and make **December 20th** a day to remember in the DeFi space with the biggest fair market launch of 2021! They have a very big idea with this hyper-deflationary, auto-vesting, always-burning $ICEBERG ecosystem being driven by that fresh new ice cold protocol. \ud83d\ude0e\n\n**Audits and listings** will also come very shortly, along with more partnerships and alliances to support the growth and expansion of the ICEBERG name and reach! This contract and project model is a no-brainer and sure to be a huge hit with the majority of investors nowadays seeking systems that work. Given the advanced, efficient ICEBERG Protocol there have been early mentions of comparisons with Safemoon. With the documented success of Frank, Halo and the team it would be safe to say that this launch will be an epic event! \ud83d\udca3\n\nSo there you have it. The final verdict is in and it says that you DEFINITELY want to be present and prepared for the Fair Market Launch of **$ICEBERG** \u2018*The coolest way to burn tokens\u2019*, as it has all the look and feel of a moonshot! \ud83c\udf11\n\nJOIN US\n\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/icebergprotocol\n\nTelegram: https:\/\/t.me\/icebergprotocol\n\n\ud83d\udd14 FAIR LAUNCH: December 20th, 2021 (at 4 pm UTC) here.\n\n*Article written by Bee Brown*\n\n  \n\n**Token Highlights**:\n\n\ud83d\udd1dLaunched by BabyCake Team\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Award Winning CEO\n\n\ud83c\udd95Innovative Protocol\n\n\ud83d\ude80Product\/Utility Already Developed\n\n\ud83d\udd253 Burn Mechanisms\n\n\ud83d\udcb5Buyback Feature\n\n\ud83d\udce2Huge Marketing\n\n\"The Coolest Way to Burn Tokens\"\n\n1% burn every day for 50 days and much more!\n\nWhat is ICEBERG\u2753\n\nICEBERG is a hyper-deflationary utility token fair launched on BEP-20.\n\n\ud83e\uddca UTILITY: \n\nICEBERG Protocol is the first Smart Locker which holds auto-vested tokens for future burns.

I've been part of this community for as long as I can remember and there's a lot of projects that look at other investors, but never get answered.. What is their vision? And every time it feels like they say TOO THE MOON! The idea is always TOO THE MOON!\n\nI'm tired of people asking \"why\" when there are no answers or visions provided to justify their project, even if they come from investors like me who have reached out before in hopes that we'll work together one day but haven't gotten much response yet (not surprising).\n\nNow here comes Embr.. A project that didnt make outlandish promises. In fact they undersold themselves. Immediately I was intrigued. I saw people across the BSC community giving opinions that ranged from straight FUD to the other side of the spectrum, being extremely bullish.\u00a0\n\nSo I did what I do best. BE A SKEPTIC!\u00a0\n\nI did extensive research about their contracts. I saw the hesitancy people had about buying presale because of the vesting and if it really worked. Now i see the praises of how well it was executed. How easy it was to buy in and now retrieve their tokens after the fact. And most importantly.. Why they built these products in an attempt to mitigate all the nonsense that I see the community I care so much about brings up on a consistent basis!\n\nThen comes the big drop.. Their partnership with Wyre! They just partnered with Avalanche and Sol (Also did anyone else notice the tokenomics that SOL and EMBR has, that there is a lot of similarity??) !! If they are able to achieve with their app the ability to purchase tokens with a credit card and swap from another with Embr Swap. Does anyone see this as a game changer!?!?!\n\nI\u2019m a skeptic and a pessimist, but looking at the project and the litepaper, seeing what the team is doing. Am I finally given something thats at least justified in spending my timing researching and giving it a fair shake? \n\nWho else feels this way!?!? I want your input!

Everyone has seen how well GM Wagmi performed on ETH, now let's show everyone that we can do even better on Solana!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGM SOL token advantages over ETH :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Gas fees almost ZERO\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Sol transaction 0.8 SEC \/ ETH 4MIN\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- GM SOL MC 60K \/ GM ETH 400M MC\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken details and features :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken name : GM solana\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken symbol : $GMsolana\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal supply : 1.000.000.000.000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCirculating supply : 800.000.000.000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLiquidity Locked \ud83d\udee1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCommunity managed utility\n\n&#x200B;\n\n63k MC \ud83d\udca5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust launched!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe GM token on the Solana ecosystem. We are all human degenerates, no matter what jpegs or coins we ape into, we all wake up and say \"good morning\". Saying good morning is more than just two words, it has become one of the strongest world wide movements in existence. It is our goal for GM Solana to put the love and positivity of the Solana community (and others) on the map. Utility and use of GM solana will be decided by the community with votes. So will everything else about this token. As far as funding goes, me and the other developper have been paying everything out of our own pockets and will continue to do so!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main problem with Ethereum based tokens is the gas fees. We all know how irritating it is to lose money for such a simple task, this is why the GM concept will perform much better on the Solana chain. Since there are almost no gas fees (0.0009$), many more people will be able to make transactions. The second problem we saw was that the transaction speed was too slow for even such a huge network. And again, this is why it will work much smoother on Solana since the transaction speed is less than a second!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoin us in our movement, wagmi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite : [https:\/\/www.gmsol.io\/](https:\/\/www.gmsol.io\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTelegram : [https:\/\/t.me\/gmsol\\_io](https:\/\/t.me\/gmsol_io)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiscord : [https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/HhpBEAfDZn](https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/HhpBEAfDZn)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwitter : [https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmsol\\_io](https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmsol_io)","581":"**Project name: Squid War**\n\n**Concept: 11,000 NFTs on Solana representing octopus ready for battle!**\n\nThe project is based on **play to earn (P2E)**. Each nft has different stats (hp, defense, attack, energy, dodge, and critical hit) which are fueled by their attributes.\n\nThe objective is to fight against other players in a \"Battle royal\" mode to win the fights.\n\nThe  clashes are in 1v1 (for the moment) turn-based and the winner gets a  reward in SOL from a wallet which is fed with 80% of the royalties and  also a part of the profits.\n\n**This game mode is free, and each nft can fight every 12 hours.**\n\nAnother  game mode will arrive after the project is released. The \"Match making\"  mode, the fights will be identical to those of the \"Battle royal\" mode  with a little subtlety.\n\nTo fight  you will have to bet an amount in SOL (0.1) and your opponent will have  to do the same. Your opponent will be chosen according to the power of  your nft, so that the fights are fair. Once the fight is over, the  winner recovers his stake and that of his opponent.\n\nThey  have lots of development ideas for the project, whether it's new  collections, skills, PVE ... but first we have to expect that I marked  above.\n\nThe release of the project is scheduled for early January (the 5th). **Public sale price : O.5 SOL**  \n**But a pre sale is already available on the website, at 0.25 sol, and the battle royal in the warzone is already available too.**\n\n**Market analysis:**  My analysis may not be the most objective, there are a lot of projects  that come out with a P2E promise that will arrive in x time.\n\nHere, they are proposing a project which is based on this principle of combat, **and which will be effective from the exit of the project**. We find it cool to be able to do something interactive, fun and to be able to reward people who join the project.\n\n**To follow the project:**\n\n**Website :** [**https:\/\/squid-war.com\/**](https:\/\/squid-war.com\/)\n\n**Warzone :** [**https:\/\/warzone.squid-war.com\/**](https:\/\/warzone.squid-war.com\/)\n\n**Twitter:** [**https:\/\/twitter.com\/SquidWarNft**](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SquidWarNft)\n\n**Discord:** [**https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/etjHpay8Z9**](https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/etjHpay8Z9)","582":" \n\n**Benchmark: The Journey so far**\n\nThe industry has seen great growth since the bull run began and as it stands now, we have seen the gains obtained during this run as one solely driven by mass adoption by the masses as they are all curious about the opportunities held within the industry as opposed that found on the traditional market.\n\nBenchmark protocol since its launch, has continued to build products that conform to the vision of being a cross-chain utility platform for users as the major objective is to provide an elastic stablecoin alternative to DeFi, and has continued to gain support across chains as DeFi has grown beyond the Ethereum Blockchain.

Chains.\n\n**Benchmark Lending Marketplace**\n\nDespite being battle-tested by the swings in the market (bearish or bullish) the MARK token has gone through 132 rebasing events and as recorded no hitch within its structure and even its tokenomics as  it has definitely proven to be a quality model for an uncollateralized stablecoin alternative that helps secures investors against liquidations and market swings, this makes the token a perfect match for the industry as the MARK token is pegged to a basket of currencies held at the SDR rate, thus making it more stable than other tokens as it has the VIX incorporated in it.\n\nOn the radar of the community is the anticipated P2P Marketplace launch that enables the close interactive lending and borrowing experiences for users, this marketplace is dubbed as the first cross-chain lender driven non-custodial platform and hence the SDR peg for MARK has been readjusted to reflect the current rate of the SDR as of April 1, 2021, which has incorporated the quarterly inflation adjustment and it\u2019s currently at $1.429 ([SDR weights as of Q2 2021.](https:\/\/www.imf.org\/external\/np\/fin\/data\/rms_sdrv.aspx))\n\nBeing an early investor in the project, the growth of the platform has been massive due to the ever-increasing, the mouth-watering APYs, Benchmark has continued to grow exponentially in the industry as the TVL currently stands at +$34.7M across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, hence this deep pool makes the MARK token, a very stable entity, with the forthcoming Marketplace launch, the TVL will be further strengthened and will see more liquidity pools being created across other blockchains as cross-chain is the hallmark of Benchmark Protocol. *Very good for investors*\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/1ciJli5.png](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/1ciJli5.png)\n\nThe marketplace smart contract has been audited by CertiK and the team is currently finalizing the front-end  of the marketplace and which will support an unlimited number of ERC-20 tokens in a P2P style under a unique UI that makes the platform scalable. The platform will support an array of different loan structures and the MARK token will be used as collateral to facilitate a risk-free engagement and borrowers will not be charged with any compound interest as the loan can be paid at any time (this is due to the unique structure of the MARK token).\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/LWkkr7Z.png](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/LWkkr7Z.png)\n\n**xMARK (**the Standard)\n\nxMARK has been the governance token of the Benchmark ecosystem following the project\u2019s fair launch and is also accessible across the chains, Benchmark is currently bridged to. Being the non-rebasing representation of the MARK token, this has been effectively utilized for the governance process via snapshots which is way ahead of the Forth token from AMPL.\n\nThe first CEX listing happened on Gate.io which is one of the preferred gateways for the easterner markets as it provides a great on-ramp experience for people to gain the MARK exposure via xMARK, currently, the exchange offers low transaction fees and sports a user-friendly platform for all to gain from the Benchmark ecosystem.\n\nNow, I\u2019m looking forward to yield harvesting and creating awareness on the forthcoming initiatives of both MARK and xMARK tokens as the team is keen on delivering key DeFi services to the blockchain ecosystem.\n\n[**Twitter**](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Benchmark_DeFi)**|**[**Telegram**](https:\/\/t.me\/benchmark_protocol)**|**[**Discord**](https:\/\/discord.gg\/v56syTZpMX)**|**[**Reddit**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BenchmarkProtocol)**|**\n\n[**website**](https:\/\/benchmarkprotocol.finance\/)","583":"[\ud83d\udcf7Low MCAP coin](https:\/\/mozartfinance.io\/) \nThis project seems to actually have a team behind it, that cares about the community from what I've researched.

Most of us have played or invest in Axieinfinity at one point while using etherum blockchain on desktop or other devices. This game has a total user base of 89.7k and recorded over $1.6 billion in total sales . A vague estimate suggests that there are approximately 300 million users of crypto worldwide. If only 5% of this population opt for Foxville farm that make 15 million users for the game in initial stages.  \n\n\nIn Foxville users can play against the environment and also against other players. Players can enter multiple universes within the game and can also trade their in-game assets with other players on Solana blockchain or other blockchains due to cross chain interoperability features. Additionally, if the player logs out of the game, his information is permanently stored on the blockchain, the user can also hold their in-game asset in form of NFTs or they can utilize their non-NFT in-game assets in other games as well, that is an intrinsic feature of blockchain gaming.\n\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Already Achieved \ud83c\udfc6\n\n# Media Coverage\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Yahoo Finance Coverage: [https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/foxville-app-first-decentralized-farm-193500496.html)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Accesswire Coverage: [https:\/\/www.accesswire.com](https:\/\/www.accesswire.com\/668613\/Foxvilleapp-is-the-First-Decentralized-Farm-Gaming-NFTs-on-Solana)\n\n***Development***\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Whitepaper: [https:\/\/foxville.app\/whitepaper.pdf](https:\/\/foxville.app\/whitepaper.pdf)\n\n\u2714\ufe0fNFTs Traits Chart: [https:\/\/foxville.app\/nft-traits](https:\/\/foxville.app\/nft-traits)\n\n***Partners***\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Solsea Marketplace Listing : [Solsea.io](https:\/\/twitter.com\/foxvilleapp\/status\/1451934538813345799)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f DigitalEye Marketplace Listing : [Digitaleye.market](https:\/\/twitter.com\/foxvilleapp\/status\/1450162596095668232)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Foxville Explainer Video : [Foxville Introduction](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EQRv3lKgPg0&t=26s)\n\n***YouTube Influencers***\n\n\u2714\ufe0f YouTube Reviews Video 1 : [www.youtube.com](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=afXI0wzFooM&t=40s)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f YouTube Reviews Video 2 : [www.youtube.com](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SOIizKXdv20)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f YouTube Reviews Video 3 : [www.youtube.com](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qn4DOp8jOqw)\n\n***Twitter Influencers***\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Crypto Celebrity onboard 1: [twitter.com\/ramironayar](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ramironayar)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Crypto Celebrity onboard 2: [twitter.com\/cryptobri\\_](https:\/\/twitter.com\/cryptobri_\/status\/1450233383183867906)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Crypto Celebrity onboard 3: [twitter.com\/oka\\_crypto](https:\/\/twitter.com\/oka_crypto\/status\/1450018783553196032)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Crypto Celebrity onboard 4: [twitter.com\/solana\\_daily](https:\/\/twitter.com\/solana_daily\/status\/1451518833513144367)\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Twitter **23k**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Telegram **24k**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Discord **16k**\n\n# \ud83c\udf8a Future Plans \ud83c\udf8a\n\n\ud83d\udccc [Solanart.io](https:\/\/\ud83d\udcccSolanart.io) marketplace listing\n\n\ud83d\udccc Play to Earn Reward\n\n\ud83d\udccc In Game Crafting\n\n\ud83d\udcccMobile Game Application\n\n\ud83d\udcccCross Chain Interoperability to support multiple blockchain\n\n\ud83d\udcccAutomated AI Bot integration\n\n\ud83d\udcccTournaments\n\n\ud83d\udcccStrategic Partnerships\n\n\ud83d\udcccMetaverse VR\/AR Game Integration\n\n\ud83d\udccc[Roadmap](https:\/\/foxville.app\/#roadmap)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 3D NFTs Tokenomics \ud83d\udcc8**\n\n***Distribution***\n\nTotal Supply of NFTs 9999\n\n1st Round 2500 \n\n2nd Round 2500\n\n3rd Round 2500\n\n4th Round 2500\n\n***Fee Percentage***\n\nResale transaction fee is 5%\n\n65% from initial sale allocated for FoxDao\n\n35% Fox Treasury\n\n***Characteristics*** \n\nCommon 60%\n\nEpic 15%\n\nLegendary 13%\n\nRare 7%\n\nSuper Rare 5%\n\n***Traits***\n\n11 Categories total 176 traits\n\n# Foxville NFTs Whitelisting\n\n***How much will it cost to mint 1 NFT ?***\n\n* They wil be priced in different bands - whitelist **0.5 SOL** and get 2D NFTs \n* Public sale **2.5 SOL** \n* 3D NFTs total it will costs you **3 SOL**\n* **Date: 25th October 4:00 PM UTC**  \n\n\n**Social Links:**\n\n* Website: [https:\/\/foxville.app\/](https:\/\/farmville.app\/)\n* Whitepaper: [https:\/\/foxville.app\/whitepaper.pdf](https:\/\/farmville.app\/whitepaper.pdf)\n* Medium: [https:\/\/foxville.medium.com\/](https:\/\/foxville.medium.com\/)\n* Github: [https:\/\/github.com\/foxvilleapp](https:\/\/github.com\/foxvilleapp)\n* Discord: [http:\/\/discord.gg\/j4d3E98J9m](http:\/\/discord.gg\/j4d3E98J9m)\n* Telegram: [https:\/\/t.me\/Foxvilleapp](https:\/\/t.me\/Foxvilleapp)\n* Twitter: [https:\/\/twitter.com\/foxvilleapp](https:\/\/twitter.com\/foxvilleapp)\n* Facebook: [https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Foxvilleapp-105878458535760](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Foxvilleapp-105878458535760)\n* YouTube: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCv0ZIW3RVgThDYKkGoSEFfA](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCv0ZIW3RVgThDYKkGoSEFfA)\n* Reddit: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/foxvilleapp\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/foxvilleapp\/)","590":"Foxville derives its competitive edge from updated features that its offer, which includes NFT staking, multiverses, cross-chain interoperability, DAO and many other features.

(Some do say, NFTs are financial bubbles, do you agree?)\n\nHmm\ud83e\udd14,\n\nEven DeFi was called all sorts of names and was declared as a gamble and a scam, but taking a good look at this sector, we got over a billion dollars and more locked in DeFi, so it's not a bubble, can you remember when DeFi started? It was just like the frenzy caused by NFT. We all know there will be a glass ceiling that needs to be broken for these unicorns to soar higher, but do we have these to bring glory to the decentralised world?\ud83d\ude44\n\nAave, Uniswap, dydx, Sushi, Mango markets, even Mirror\/Synthetix comes to mind as key players in driving home the decentralized finance goals, but these haven't been able to bend the rules as to allow the illiquidity of NFTs come play in these league. Well, that's the twist, GovWorld through its jewel, GovLend brings to the block.\n\nWe can get our NFTs collateralised and suck out stablecoins from within this protocol, a very useful case for DeFi as we got huge amounts of money lying fallow in our wallets. I understand the cultural value NFTs bring to us as a society, but we can get more from them while still being a member of our communities like the BAYC or MAYC.\n\nFinally Govworld, is all about the community and is backed by DAOs (Protocol DAOs namely; DuckDAO and Ferrum Network) and got it's private sale on DDIM sold out under 5 minutes, soon FRM and FRMx holders will get an opportunity to participate in an exclusive strategic partner's pool for the GOV tokens (this is also opened to other partners). Meanwhile, it's still 3 days to the closure of its early adopters reward contest.\n\nWith Govworld on the block, DeFi summer just got heated.

One of ClosedSea\u2019s primary focus areas is to provide the most affordable fees in the NFT Marketplace space. ClosedSea offers two options to this problem:\n\nUser Experience: ClosedSea is also designed to offer the best create, buy, collect and sell experience at par or better with market leaders by offering a familiar and predictable interface lacking on platforms outside the ETH network.\n\nReliability: Closedsea is designed to offer reliable transaction security, high availability, less to no failed transaction further enhancing our attractiveness to the wider NFT economy.\n\n \n\n\u2705 ClosedSea Testnet will be going live this Monday, 1st November 2021 \n\n\u2705 Launched 3 days ago\n\n\u2705 Max.

Each day, on various subreddits, you can see a ton of those low market cap tokens being promoted, most of them being generally absolute trash. But sometimes, some low market cap tokens manage to get out of the P&D scheme and grow to achieve a stable growth, whether it be thanks to their community, devteam, communication, website, purpose, etc. \n\nSome examples are well-known like SafeMoon or Hoge. These tokens managed to stand out from the crowd of low market cap tokens they originated from, and establish themselves as recognizable elements of the crypto scene, which is very rare, as most  low mcap tokens just get abandoned by their devteam or are simply scams.\n\nBut you don't simply get from \"low market cap shitcoin\" to \"recognizable token and project, backed up by a strong community and hundreds of thousands of holders\" in an instant, there are multiple steps in between.\n\nThe good thing is, when a token manages to emerge from the crowd of other low mcap tokens, it generally proves itself as a safe and valuable project, it shows that it can rely on a sustainable, long-term growth, instead of simply getting abandoned after the first big pump, which a lot of tokens do. But it doesn't mean that it has achieved the peak of its growth. Generally speaking, it's just the beginning of something much bigger.\n\nI've been rugpulled and scammed a few times now, and even though I lost money, I also learned very valuable informations, and good investment practices that are already paying off for me. Diversifying my investment into 3 or more tokens is one of them, I also choose very carefully which project I invest money into: how active is the devteam? What does the website look like? Are there any whales? Are the LP tokens locked or burned? Etc.\n\nWith those investment practices in mind, I went and searched on various subreddits some low market cap tokens to invest into. I immediately noticed one young project: $OCTA. Even at the very beginning, the website was one of the best I had ever seen in the crypto scene, the devteam was really active and responsive on TG and social media, the LP tokens were locked, and the liquidity was generally pretty good thanks to a 4% tax on each transaction, which contributed to liquidity.\n\nToday, I know that I was right in picking up this project, it emerged from the crowd of low market cap tokens to become a somewhat recognizable and impactful project, which of course translated to very interesting gains.\n\nAt the moment I'm writing this post, almost 8000 wallets hold $OCTA. It means that it has managed to secure the investors' confidence for a more sustainable and log-term growth, but also that it could grow to even higher heights if the community and devteam continue their efforts.\n\nI believe that $OCTA is only at a fraction of its full potential, and that we will keep hearing more about it in the weeks and months to come. It's not a hidden gem anymore, but it has only just begun its growth. I'll be in during that time, what about you?\n\nIf you've made it this far, well congratulations!
