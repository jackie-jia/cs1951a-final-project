Certificate pairs allow us to establish identity and verify it. It's a solved problem that is already in use everywhere. Sure you could enshrine that in blockchain, i suppose but i dont really see what that gets you. Sometimes you want to rotate certificates so what does immutability give you?

But if you're raising* ***4500 BNB*** *(!!). Who else is left to buy the coin? And if there is no buying pressure (because everyone that wanted to buy already bought in presale) why won't it dump? Is there a vesting period that will prevent people from dumping as soon as it is listed on Pancake?*\n\nPS - the prototype they presented in a video is just a mockup, it is not actually working product or even an MVP or alpha version.\n\nPS 2: I did buy (FOMO, got lost in the initial hype) and only started thinking critically after I had thrown in couple of BNBs","3977":"I don't seem to see MarketMove listed on David Lacroff LinkedIn.","3978":"haha )","3979":"drop by tg, very nice community by the way","3980":"yep, our marketing guys are working hard","3981":"Dump? Even if you've bought on the private sale, you're only 26% up on your investment on launch. Not to mention it's only 8% after sell tax. Sell a long term massive project like this for 8% gain? Lol","3982":"Tell this to MiniDoge, which raised 5000 BNB and got to 450M market cap xddd I am active in the group and I know they have $250,000 marketing budget. Your DYOR and fud game is weak. I invested 2.5 BNB and saw the same exact comment on DXSale. How much do they pay you to fud for no reason?\n\nAlso, the dev team is from top companies in yhe world. Their COO is a Partner at a cool AI consulting firm with Financial Times interview.\n\nsigmoidal[.]io\n\nYou are not smart if you keep fudding your own investment...","3983":"Thanks for the heads up!","3984":"I see it under his activity","3985":"nice community? I was insta-banned for asking a simple question. This is after the fact that I had already made BNB contributions in the DXsale.","3986":"You don't understand - I asked that question and they did not give me ANY answer, they instantly banned me. They could have replied with what you just said but they simply banned me. It looks suspicious and I am worried they're planning mother of all scams. I don't know what scam but their behavior is pretty suspicous.","3987":"As I said, I invested BNB because I was taken in by the hype and only started thinking critically after. Now it is too late for me, for sure, but it is not late for other potential investors. If they don't reach their SC, they wont be able to launch and people who invested BNBs will get it back from DXSale. But if they do reach it, then it is now looking very likely that we (I say we because I've already invested) will fall victims to god knows what scam they are planning.\n\nAlso, now there is chatter about them having deep faked doxxed founder. In fact, go ahead and look at their product demo video. Looks like a theme purchased from template monster or something, nothing working.","3988":"Zero problems with both Michael and Adam so far, and I've asked a lot.","3989":"That's what you see, yes. But the fact is that this group is structured for tens of thousands of people. The questions\/fud surrounding the SC\/HC were being asked every ten seconds, so of course they would have zero tolerance for that after a while. They know what they're doing, and so do all the fudders. This will be a glorious project.","3990":"Lol, wont waste more of my time talking with you. You\u2019re too paranoid. You really think they will scam after fully doxxing and even doxxing their real-world business? You just have a PTSD from being rugpulled so hard and cannot trust anyone. Go see a therapist please. I\u2019m serious. They are millionaires already, definitely want to steal 50k split for 6 people xDDD","3991":"That's a good perspective. I find their behavior not compatible with behaviors of legit projects. I invested 2 BNB and in my head I've accepted that these 2 BNB will most likely be scammed because the company's behavior does not inspire any trust or confidence. It is not a big amount for me, I lose it, I lose it, life goes on.  But I wanted to share my experience with people so they can decide for themselves. My experience is just one  data point that people will consider, my experience is not the only data point.  Everyone is going to do their own research and consider good\/bad and decide. Like if you were checking Yelp for reviews of a business, you'll see good\/bad and decide for yourself.","3992":"Do you not understand what I'm saying? I am saying that their behavior is so suspicious that their doxxing could be fake. Wasn't there another scam recently where they devs claimed to have been doxxed but in reality used stock photos!","3993":"I did my research and bought in 1 BNB during the private sale because I also was swept up in the hype and the David LaCroff guy seemed legit enough. Michael Novack, on the other hand, I can\u2019t find any information about despite his impressive credentials on the MarketMove site, which doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. He is the one in all the doxxing videos.\n\nEdit: people keep responding to me about his work history with a company called Sig-something and deleting their comments... what\u2019s up with that??
